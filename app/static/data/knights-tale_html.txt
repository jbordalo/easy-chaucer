<dfn data-note="once">Whilom</dfn>, as olde <dfn data-note="histories">stories</dfn> tellen us,
Ther was a <dfn data-note="duke">duc</dfn> that <dfn data-note="was called">highte</dfn> Theseus;
Of Atthenes he was lord and governour,
And in his tyme swich a conquerour
That gretter was ther noon under the sonne.
Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne;
What with his wysdom and his chivalrie,
He conquered al the <dfn data-note="country of the Amazons, land of women">regne of Femenye</dfn>,
That whilom was ycleped Scithia,
And weddede the queene Ypolita,
And broghte hire hoom with hym in his contree
With muchel glorie and greet <dfn data-note="splendor, ceremony">solempnytee</dfn>,
And eek hir yonge <dfn data-note="sister">suster</dfn> Emelye.
And thus with victorie and with melodye
Lete I this noble duc to Atthenes ryde,
And al his hoost in armes hym bisyde.
And <dfn data-note="certainly mere = ne were, were not">certes</dfn>, if it nere to long to <dfn data-note="hear">heere</dfn>,
I wolde have toold yow fully the manere
How wonnen was the regne of Femenye
By Theseus and by his <dfn data-note="knights">chivalrye</dfn>;
And of the grete bataille for the nones
Bitwixen Atthenes and Amazones;
And how <dfn data-note="besieged">asseged</dfn> was Ypolita,
The faire, hardy queene of Scithia;
And of the <dfn data-note="festivity">feste</dfn> that was at hir weddynge,
And of the <dfn data-note="storm">tempest</dfn> at hir hoom-comynge;
But al that thyng I <dfn data-note="must now forgo">moot as now forbere</dfn>.
I have, God woot, a large feeld to <dfn data-note="plow">ere</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="weak">wayke</dfn> been the oxen in my plough.
The remenant of the tale is long ynough.

And lat se now who shal the soper wynne;
And <dfn data-note="where">ther</dfn> I lefte, I wol <dfn data-note="again">ayeyn</dfn> bigynne.
This duc, of whom I make mencioun,
Whan he was come almoost unto the toun,
In al his <dfn data-note="prosperity">wele</dfn> and in his mooste pride,
He was <dfn data-note="aware">war</dfn>, as he caste his eye aside,
Where that ther kneled in the heighe weye
A compaignye of ladyes, <dfn data-note="two by two">tweye and tweye</dfn>,

But swich a cry and swich a wo they make
That in this world <dfn data-note="ne ys, iS not">nys</dfn> creature lyvynge

"What folk been ye, that at myn homcomynge

Quod Theseus. "Have ye so greet envye
Of myn honour, that thus <dfn data-note="lament">compleyne</dfn> and crye?
Or who hath yow <dfn data-note="injured">mysboden</dfn> or offended?
And telleth me if it may been amended,
And why that ye been clothed thus in blak."
The eldeste lady of hem alle spak,
Whan she hadde <dfn data-note="swooned, fainted">swowned</dfn> with a <dfn data-note="deathlike look">deedly cheere</dfn>,
That it was <dfn data-note="pity, a sorrowful matter">routhe</dfn> for to seen and heere;

Whil that the <dfn data-note="siege">seege</dfn> theraboute lay.
And yet now the olde Creon — <dfn data-note="alas">weylaway</dfn>! —

And with that word, withouten moore <dfn data-note="delay, respite">respit</dfn>,

But onward on <dfn data-note="he spent the night on the road">his wey that nyght he lay</dfn>,
And sente anon Ypolita the queene,
And Emelye, hir yonge suster <dfn data-note="bright">sheene</dfn>,
Unto the toun of Atthenes to dwelle,
And forth he <dfn data-note="rideth, rides">rit</dfn>; ther is namoore to telle.
The rede statue of Mars, with spere and <dfn data-note="shield">targe</dfn>,
So shyneth in his white baner large
That alle the <dfn data-note="fields glitter all about">feeldes glyteren up and doun</dfn>;
And by his baner born is his penoun
Of gold ful riche, in which ther was <dfn data-note="embroidered">ybete</dfn>
The <dfn data-note="the monster slain by Theseus">Mynotaur</dfn>, which that he <dfn data-note="conquered">wan</dfn> in Crete.
Thus rit this duc, thus rit this conquerour,
And in his hoost of chivalrie the flour,
Til that he cam to Thebes and alighte
Faire in a feeld, ther as he <dfn data-note="intended">thoughte</dfn> to fighte.
But shortly for to speken of this thyng,
With Creon, which that was of Thebes kyng,
He faught, and slough hym manly as a knyght
In <dfn data-note="open battle">pleyn bataille</dfn>, and putte the folk to flyght;
And by <dfn data-note="assault">assaut</dfn> he wan the citee after,
And <dfn data-note="tore down">rente adoun</dfn> bothe wall and <dfn data-note="beam">sparre</dfn> and rafter;
And to the ladyes he restored agayn
The bones of hir <dfn data-note="husbands">freendes</dfn> that were slayn,
To doon obsequies, as was <dfn data-note="then the custom">tho the gyse</dfn>.
But it were al to longe for to <dfn data-note="tell">devyse</dfn>
The grete clamour and the <dfn data-note="lamentation">waymentynge</dfn>
That the ladyes made at the <dfn data-note="burning">brennynge</dfn>
Of the bodies, and the grete honour
That Theseus, the noble conquerour,
Dooth to the ladyes, whan they from hym wente;
But shortly for to telle is myn <dfn data-note="intention">entente</dfn>.
Whan that this worthy duc, this Theseus,
Hath Creon slayn and wonne Thebes thus,
Stille in that feeld he took al nyght his reste,
And dide with al the contree <dfn data-note="as he pleased">as hym leste</dfn>.
To <dfn data-note="search">ransake</dfn> in the <dfn data-note="heap">taas</dfn> of bodyes dede,
Hem for to <dfn data-note="strip">strepe</dfn> of <dfn data-note="armor">harneys</dfn> and of <dfn data-note="clothing">wede</dfn>,
The <dfn data-note="scavengers">pilours</dfn> <dfn data-note="took great pains, worked hard">diden bisynesse and cure</dfn>
After the bataille and <dfn data-note="defeat">disconfiture</dfn>.
And so bifel that in the taas they founde,
<dfn data-note="pierced through">Thurgh-girt</dfn> with many a grevous blody wounde,
Two yonge knyghtes <dfn data-note="lying side by side">liggynge by and by</dfn>,
Bothe <dfn data-note="with the same heraldic device">in oon armes</dfn>, wroght ful richely,
Of whiche two Arcita highte that oon,
And that oother knyght highte Palamon.
Nat fully <dfn data-note="living">quyke</dfn>, ne fully dede they were,
But by hir <dfn data-note="tunics embroidered with heraldic devices, wom over the armor">cote-armures</dfn> and by hir <dfn data-note="armor">gere</dfn>
The <dfn data-note="heralds">heraudes</dfn> knewe hem best <dfn data-note="in particular">in special</dfn>
As they that weren of the blood roial
Of Thebes, and of <dfn data-note="sisters">sustren</dfn> two yborn.
Out of the taas the pilours han hem torn,
And han hem caried <dfn data-note="gently">softe</dfn> unto the tente
Of Theseus; and he ful soone hem sente
To Atthenes, to dwellen in prisoun
Perpetuelly — he <dfn data-note="would not accept any ransom—">nolde no raunsoun</dfn>.
And whan this worthy duc hath thus ydon,
He took his hoost, and hoom he <dfn data-note="rideth, rides">rit</dfn> anon
With <dfn data-note="laurel">laurer</dfn> crowned as a conquerour;
And ther he lyveth in joye and in honour
<dfn data-note="for the duration">Terme</dfn> of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo?
And in a <dfn data-note="tower">tour</dfn>, in angwissh and in wo,
This Palamon and his felawe Arcite
For everemoore; ther <dfn data-note="can ransom them">may no gold hem quite</dfn>.
This passeth yeer by yeer and day by day,
Till it <dfn data-note="once happened">fil ones</dfn>, in a morwe of May,
That Emelye, that fairer was <dfn data-note="to be seen, to look upon">to sene</dfn>
Than is the lylie upon his stalke grene,
And fressher than the May with floures newe —
For with the rose colour <dfn data-note="her hue strove (vied with)">stroof hire hewe</dfn>,
I <dfn data-note="ne woot, do not know">noot</dfn> which was the fyner of hem two —
Er it were day, as was hir <dfn data-note="custom, wont">wone</dfn> to do,
She was arisen and al redy <dfn data-note="prepared">dight</dfn>,
For May wole have no <dfn data-note="sluggishness, laziness">slogardie</dfn> <dfn data-note="at night">anyght</dfn>.
The <dfn data-note="season">sesoun</dfn> <dfn data-note="spurs, incites">priketh</dfn> every gentil herte,
And maketh it out of his slep to <dfn data-note="move suddenly, awake">sterte</dfn>,
And seith "Arys, and do thyn observaunce."
This maked Emelye have remembraunce
To doon honour to May, and for to ryse.
Yclothed was she fressh, for to devyse:
Hir yelow heer was <dfn data-note="braided">broyded</dfn> in a tresse
Bihynde hir bak, a <dfn data-note="yard">yerde</dfn> long, I gesse.
And in the gardyn, at the <dfn data-note="rising of the sun">sonne upriste</dfn>,
She walketh up and doun, and as <dfn data-note="it pleased her, she liked">hire liste</dfn>
She gadereth floures, party white and rede,
To make a <dfn data-note="ingenious, skillfully made, wreath">subtil gerland</dfn> for hire hede;
And as an aungel <dfn data-note="in a heavenly manner">hevenysshly</dfn> she soong.
The grete tour, that was so thikke and stroong,
Which of the castel was the chief <dfn data-note="keep, main fortification of a castle">dongeoun</dfn>
(Ther as the knyghtes weren in prisoun
Of which I tolde yow and tellen shal),
Was <dfn data-note="just next to">evene joynant</dfn> to the gardyn wal
Ther as this Emelye hadde hir <dfn data-note="amusement">pleyynge</dfn>.
Bright was the sonne and cleer that morwenynge,
And Palamoun, this woful prisoner,
As was his wone, <dfn data-note="with permission of his jailer">by leve of his gayler</dfn>,
Was risen and romed in a chambre <dfn data-note="on high">an heigh</dfn>,
In which he al the noble citee <dfn data-note="saw">seigh</dfn>,
And eek the gardyn, ful of braunches grene,
Ther as this fresshe Emelye the <dfn data-note="bright">shene</dfn>
Was in hire walk, and romed up and doun.
This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun,
Goth in the chambre romynge to and fro
And to hymself <dfn data-note="lamenting">compleynynge of</dfn> his wo.
That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, "allas!"
And so bifel, by aventure or cas,
That <dfn data-note="through =">thurgh</dfn> a wyndow, <dfn data-note="thick(ly set) with">thikke of</dfn> many a barre
Of iren greet and square as any <dfn data-note="wooden beam">sparre</dfn>,
He cast his eye upon Emelya,
And therwithal he <dfn data-note="turned pale">bleynte</dfn> and cride, "A!"
As though he stongen were unto the herte.
And with that cry Arcite anon up <dfn data-note="leapt up">sterte</dfn> 
And seyde, "<dfn data-note="kinsman">Cosyn</dfn> myn, what <dfn data-note="ails">eyleth</dfn> thee,
That art so pale and deedly <dfn data-note="to look upon">on to see</dfn>?
Why <dfn data-note="cridest thow, did you cry out">cridestow</dfn>? Who hath thee doon offence?
For Goddes love, taak al in pacience
Oure prisoun, for it may noon oother be.
Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee.
Som wikke aspect or disposicioun

<dfn data-note="Some evil aspect or disposition of the planet Saturn, by arrangement of the heavenly bodies (constellacioun) has given us this (fate, which we must suffer) although we had sworn the contrary (would befall).">Hath yeven us this, although we hadde it sworn;</dfn>
So stood the hevene whan that we were born.
We moste endure it; <dfn data-note="pronounced as one syllable">this is</dfn> the short and playn."
This Palamon answerde and seyde <dfn data-note="in reply">agayn</dfn>,
"Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun
Thow hast a <dfn data-note="idle, foolish conception">veyn ymaginacioun</dfn>. 
This prison caused me nat for to crye,
But I was hurt right now thurghout myn <dfn data-note="eye">ye</dfn>
Into myn herte, that wol my <dfn data-note="killer">bane</dfn> be.
The fairnesse of that lady that I see
Yond in the gardyn romen to and fro
Is cause of al my criyng and my wo.
I <dfn data-note="ne wool, know not">noot</dfn> <dfn data-note="whether">wher</dfn> she be womman or goddesse,
But Venus is it soothly, as I gesse."
And therwithal on knees doun he fil,
And seyde, "Venus, if it be thy wil
Yow in this gardyn thus to transfigure
Bifore me, sorweful, wrecched creature,
Out of this prisoun help that we may <dfn data-note="escape">scapen</dfn>.
And if so be my destynee be <dfn data-note="ordained">shapen</dfn>
By eterne word to dyen in prisoun,
Of oure <dfn data-note="noble birth">lynage</dfn> have som compassioun,
That is so lowe ybroght by tirannye."
And with that word Arcite <dfn data-note="did espy, saw">gan espye</dfn>
Wher as this lady romed to and fro,
And with that sighte hir beautee hurte hym so,
That, if that Palamon was wounded sore,
Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or moore.
And with a sigh he seyde pitously, eae
The fresshe beautee sleeth me <dfn data-note="suddenly">sodeynly</dfn>
Of hire that rometh in the yonder place;
And <dfn data-note="unless">but</dfn> I have hir mercy and hir grace,
That I may seen hire <dfn data-note="at least">atte leeste weye</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="I am as good as dead">I nam but deed</dfn>; ther nis namoore to seye."
This Palamon, whan he <dfn data-note="those">tho</dfn> wordes herde,
<dfn data-note="angrily">Dispitously</dfn> he looked and answerde,
"<dfn data-note="tell me whether you say (seistouw = seiest thou) this">Wheither seistow</dfn> this in ernest or in pley?"
"Nay," quod Arcite, "in ernest, by my <dfn data-note="faith">fey</dfn>!
God helpe me so, <dfn data-note="I have very little desire to play">me list ful yvele pleye</dfn>."
This Palamon gan knytte his browes tweye.
"It <dfn data-note="ne were, would not be (subj.)">nere</dfn>," quod he, "to thee no greet honour

Nay, certes, false Arcite, thow shalt nat so.

As to my conseil and my brother sworn

This Arcite ful proudly spak <dfn data-note="in return">ageyn</dfn>:
"Thow shalt," quod he, "be rather fals than I;

Perpetuelly; <dfn data-note="no ransom avails (can help) us">us gayneth no raunsoun</dfn>.
We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon;
They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon.
Ther cam a kyte, whil that they were so <dfn data-note="angry">wrothe</dfn>,
And baar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe.
And therfore, at the kynges court, my brother,
Ech man for hymself, ther is <dfn data-note="no other (way)">noon oother</dfn>.
Love, if thee list, for I love and <dfn data-note="always">ay</dfn> shal;

Heere in this prisoun moote we endure,
And <dfn data-note="each">everich</dfn> of us take his aventure."
Greet was the strif and long bitwix hem tweye,
If that I hadde leyser for to seye;
But to <dfn data-note="the point">th’effect</dfn>. It happed on a day,
To telle it yow as shortly as I may,
A worthy duc that highte Perotheus,
That felawe was unto duc Theseus
<dfn data-note="since">Syn</dfn> <dfn data-note="that">thilke</dfn> day that they were children <dfn data-note="little">lite</dfn>,
Was come to Atthenes his felawe to visite,
And for to pleye as he was wont to do;
For in this world he loved no man so,
And he loved hym als tendrely agayn.
So wel they lovede, as olde bookes sayn,
That whan that oon was deed, soothly to telle,
His felawe wente and soughte hym doun in helle —
But of that storie list me nat to write.
Duc Perotheus loved wel Arcite,
And hadde hym knowe at Thebes <dfn data-note="year after year, for a long time">yeer by yere</dfn>,
And finally at requeste and preyere
Of Perotheus, withouten any raunsoun,
Duc Theseus hym leet out of prisoun
Frely to goon wher that hym liste over al,
In swich a <dfn data-note="manner">gyse</dfn> as I you tellen shal.
This was the <dfn data-note="agreement">forward</dfn>, pleynly for t’endite,
Bitwixen Theseus and <dfn data-note="this Arcite">hym Arcite</dfn>:
That if so were that Arcite were yfounde
Evere in his lif, by day or nyght, <dfn data-note="at one (i.e., any) moment">oo stounde</dfn>
In any contree of this Theseus,
And he were caught, it was acorded thus,
That with a swerd he sholde <dfn data-note="lose">lese</dfn> his heed.
Ther nas noon oother remedie ne <dfn data-note="course of action">reed</dfn>; 
But taketh his leve, and homward he <dfn data-note="hurried">him spedde</dfn>.
Lat hym be war! His nekke <dfn data-note="lies as a pledge">lith to wedde</dfn>.
How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite!
The deeth he feeleth thurgh his herte smyte;
He wepeth, wayleth, crieth pitously;
To <dfn data-note="slay, kill">sleen</dfn> hymself he <dfn data-note="awaits an occasion">waiteth</dfn> <dfn data-note="secretly">prively</dfn>.
He seyde, "Allas that day that I was born!
Now is my prisoun worse than biforn;
Now <dfn data-note="I am destined">is me shape</dfn> eternally to dwelle
Noght in purgatorie, but in helle.
Allas, that evere knew I Perotheus!
For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus,
Yfetered in his prisoun everemo.
Thanne hadde I been in blisse and nat in wo.
Oonly the sighte of hire whom that I serve,
Though that I nevere hir grace may deserve,
Wolde han suffised right ynough for me.
O deere cosyn Palamon," quod he,
"Thyn is the victorie of this aventure.
Ful blisfully in prison <dfn data-note="you can live">maistow dure</dfn> —
In prison? <dfn data-note="certainly not">Certes nay</dfn>, but in paradys!
Wel hath Fortune <dfn data-note="cast the dice for you">yturned thee the dys</dfn>,
That hast the sighte of hire, and I th’absence.
For possible is, syn thou hast hire presence,
And art a knyght, a worthy and an able,

"Allas, why <dfn data-note="complain">pleynen</dfn> folk so in commune

That in his hous is <dfn data-note="by the members of his household">of his meynee</dfn> slayn.
Infinite harmes been in this mateere.
We <dfn data-note="know">witen</dfn> nat what thing we preyen heere;
We <dfn data-note="act">faren</dfn> as he that dronke is as a mous.
A dronke man woot wel he hath an hous,
But he noot which the righte wey is <dfn data-note="thither, there">thider</dfn>,
And to a dronke man the wey is <dfn data-note="slippery">slider</dfn>.
And <dfn data-note="certainly">certes</dfn>, in this world so faren we;
We seken faste after felicitee,
But we goon wrong ful often, trewely.
Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I,
That <dfn data-note="supposed">wende</dfn> and hadde a greet opinioun
That if I myghte escapen from prisoun,
Thanne hadde I been in joye and parfit <dfn data-note="well-being">heele</dfn>,

Syn that I may nat seen you, Emelye,

Upon that oother syde Palamon,
Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon,
Swich sorwe he maketh that the grete tour
<dfn data-note="resounded with">Resouneth of</dfn> his <dfn data-note="howling">youlyng</dfn> and clamour.
The <dfn data-note="very fetters">pure fettres</dfn> on his shynes <dfn data-note="large (probably to be construed with fetters )">grete</dfn>
Weren of his bittre, salte teeres wete.
"Allas," quod he, "Arcita, cosyn myn,
Of al oure strif, God woot, the fruyt is thyn.

That by som aventure or some tretee

For, as by wey of possibilitee,
Sith thou art at thy large, of prisoun free,
And art a lord, greet is thyn <dfn data-note="advantage">avauntage</dfn>
Moore than is myn, that sterve here in a cage.
For I moot wepe and wayle, whil I lyve,
With al the wo that prison may me yive,
And eek with peyne that love me yeveth also,
That doubleth al my torment and my wo."
Therwith the fyr of jalousie up sterte
Withinne his brest, and hente him by the herte
So <dfn data-note="madly, passionately">woodly</dfn> that he <dfn data-note="to look upon was like">lyk was to biholde</dfn>
The boxtree or the asshen dede and colde.
Thanne seyde he, "O crueel goddes that governe
This world with byndyng of youre word <dfn data-note="eternal">eterne</dfn>,
And writen in the <dfn data-note="tablet of adamant (hardest of stones)">table of atthamaunt</dfn>
Youre <dfn data-note="decision">parlement</dfn> and youre eterne <dfn data-note="decree">graunt</dfn>,
What is mankynde moore unto you <dfn data-note="obligated">holde</dfn>
Than is the sheep that <dfn data-note="cowers">rouketh</dfn> in the folde?
For slayn is man right as another beest,
And dwelleth eek in prison and <dfn data-note="restraint">arreest</dfn>, 
And hath siknesse and greet adversitee,

And yet encresseth this al my <dfn data-note="suffering">penaunce</dfn>,
That man is bounden to his <dfn data-note="duty">observaunce</dfn>,

<dfn data-note="whereas">Ther as</dfn> a beest may al his <dfn data-note="desire">lust</dfn> fulfille.
And whan a beest is deed he hath no peyne;
But man after his deeth moot wepe and <dfn data-note="lament">pleyne</dfn>,
Though in this world he have care and wo.
Withouten doute it may stonden so.
The answere of this <dfn data-note="leave">lete</dfn> I to <dfn data-note="theologians">dyvynys</dfn>,
But wel I woot that in this world greet <dfn data-note="pain">pyne</dfn> ys.
Allas, I se a serpent or a theef,
That many a <dfn data-note="honest">trewe</dfn> man hath doon <dfn data-note="wrong">mescheef</dfn>,
Goon <dfn data-note="freely">at his large</dfn>, and where hym list may turne.
But I moot been in prisoun <dfn data-note="through, because of">thurgh</dfn> Saturne,
And eek thurgh Juno, jalous and eek wood,
That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood
Of Thebes with his <dfn data-note="wasted, devastated">waste</dfn> walles wyde;
And Venus sleeth me on that oother syde
For jalousie and <dfn data-note="fear">fere</dfn> of <dfn data-note="this Arcite">hym Arcite</dfn>."
Now wol I <dfn data-note="cease (speaking) of">stynte of</dfn> Palamon a lite,
And lete hym in his prisoun stille dwelle,
And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle.
The somer passeth, and the nyghtes longe
Encressen double wise the peynes stronge
Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner.
I noot which hath the wofuller <dfn data-note="occupation">mester</dfn>.
For, shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun
Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun,
In cheynes and in fettres to been deed;
And Arcite is exiled <dfn data-note="on threat of losing his head">upon his heed</dfn>
For everemo, <dfn data-note="(to be) out of">as out of</dfn> that contree,
Ne nevere mo ne shal his lady see.
Yow loveres axe I now this <dfn data-note="logical problem (of love); see n.">questioun</dfn>:
Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun?
That oon may seen his lady day by day,
But in prison he moot dwelle alway;
That oother wher hym list may <dfn data-note="ride or walk">ride or go</dfn>,
But seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
Now <dfn data-note="judge">demeth</dfn> as yow liste, ye that <dfn data-note="know how">kan</dfn>,
For I wol telle forth as I bigan.

Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was,
Ful ofte a day he <dfn data-note="grew faint">swelte</dfn> and seyde "Allas!"
For seen his lady shal he nevere mo.
And shortly to concluden al his wo,
So muche sorwe hadde nevere creature
That is, or shal, whil that the world may <dfn data-note="last">dure</dfn>.
His slep, his mete, his drynke, is hym <dfn data-note="taken away from">biraft</dfn>,
That <dfn data-note="he became lean">lene he wex</dfn> and drye as is a <dfn data-note="stick">shaft</dfn>,
His eyen <dfn data-note="sunken">holwe</dfn> and grisly to biholde,
His hewe <dfn data-note="sickly yellow">falow</dfn> and pale as asshen colde,
And solitarie he was and evere allone,
And waillynge al the nyght, <dfn data-note="lamenting">makynge his mone</dfn>;
And if he herde song or instrument,
Thanne wolde he wepe, he myghte nat be <dfn data-note="stopped">stent</dfn>.
So feble eek were his spiritz, and so lowe,
And chaunged so, that no man koude knowe
His speche nor his <dfn data-note="voice">voys</dfn>, though men it herde.
And in his <dfn data-note="behavior">geere</dfn> for al the world he <dfn data-note="behaved">ferde</dfn>
Nat oonly lik the <dfn data-note="love-sickness; see n. to lines 1355-76.">loveris maladye</dfn>
<dfn data-note="love-sickness; see n. to lines 1355-76.">Of Hereos</dfn>, but rather lyk <dfn data-note="mania">manye</dfn>,
Engendred of <dfn data-note="melancholy humor">humour malencolik</dfn>
Biforen, in his <dfn data-note="the part of the brain that controls the imagination">celle fantastik</dfn>.
And shortly, turned was al <dfn data-note="topsy turvy">up so doun</dfn>
Bothe <dfn data-note="physical condition">habit</dfn> and eek disposicioun
Of hym, this woful lovere <dfn data-note="sir">daun</dfn> Arcite.
What sholde I <dfn data-note="at length">al day</dfn> of his wo <dfn data-note="write">endite</dfn>?
Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
This crueel torment and this peyne and wo,
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
Upon a nyght in sleep as he hym leyde,
Hym thoughte how that the wynged god <dfn data-note="Mercury">Mercurie</dfn>
Biforn hym stood and bad hym to be murie.
His <dfn data-note="slecp-inducing staff">slepy yerde</dfn> in hond he bar uprighte;
An hat he werede upon his heris brighte.
Arrayed was this god, as <dfn data-note="Arcite took heed, noticed">he took keep</dfn>,
As he was whan that <dfn data-note="mythical guardian of lo, whom Mercury put to sleep and then killed">Argus</dfn> took his sleep;
And seyde hym thus: "To Atthenes shaltou wende,
Ther is thee <dfn data-note="destined">shapen</dfn> of thy wo an ende."
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
"Now trewely, <dfn data-note="however sorely it may pain me">hou soore that me smerte</dfn>,"
Quod he, "to Atthenes right now wol I <dfn data-note="go">fare</dfn>,
Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
To se my lady, that I love and serve.
In hire presence I recche nat to <dfn data-note="care not if I die">sterve</dfn>."
And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,
And saugh his visage al <dfn data-note="(changed) into another sort">in another kynde</dfn>.
And right anon it ran hym in his mynde,
That, <dfn data-note="since">sith</dfn> his face was so disfigured
<dfn data-note="by illness">Of maladye</dfn> the which he hadde endured,
He <dfn data-note="could">myghte</dfn> wel, if that he <dfn data-note="conducted himself humbly">bar hym lowe</dfn>,
Lyve in Atthenes everemoore unknowe,
And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
And <dfn data-note="at once">right anon</dfn> he chaunged his array,
And cladde hym as a povre laborer,
And al allone, save oonly a squier
That knew his <dfn data-note="private affairs">privetee</dfn> and al his <dfn data-note="situation">cas</dfn>,
Which was disgised <dfn data-note="poorly">povrely</dfn> as he was,
To Atthenes is he goon the <dfn data-note="nearest">nexte</dfn> way.
And to the court he wente upon a day,
And at the gate he <dfn data-note="offers">profreth</dfn> his servyse
To <dfn data-note="drudge and draw water">drugge and drawe</dfn>, what so men wol <dfn data-note="command">devyse</dfn>.
And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
He <dfn data-note="fell in service, was employed">fil in office</dfn> with a <dfn data-note="household attendant">chamberleyn</dfn>
The which that dwellynge was with Emelye,
For he was wys and koude soone <dfn data-note="take notice, take the measure of">espye,</dfn>
<dfn data-note="take notice, take the measure of">Of</dfn> every servaunt, which that serveth here.
Wel koude he hewen wode, and water <dfn data-note="bear, carry">bere</dfn>,
For he was yong and myghty for the nones,
And therto he was <dfn data-note="tall">long</dfn> and <dfn data-note="strong">big</dfn> of bones
To doon that any <dfn data-note="person">wight</dfn> kan hym devyse.
A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
<dfn data-note="personal servant">Page of the chambre</dfn> of Emelye the brighte,
And Philostrate he seyde that he <dfn data-note="was called">highte</dfn>.
But half so wel biloved a man as he
Ne was ther nevere in court of his degree;
He was so gentil of <dfn data-note="disposition, manner">condicioun</dfn>
That thurghout al the court was his <dfn data-note="fame, renown">renoun</dfn>.
They seyden that it were a charitee
That Theseus wolde <dfn data-note="advance, enhance his rank">enhauncen his degree</dfn>,
And putten hym in <dfn data-note="honorable, noble employment">worshipful servyse</dfn>,
Ther as he myghte his <dfn data-note="abilities">vertu</dfn> excercise.
And thus withinne a while his <dfn data-note="reputation">name</dfn> is spronge,
Bothe of his dedes and his goode tonge,
That Theseus hath taken hym so <dfn data-note="near (though this is usually the comparative nearer)">neer</dfn>
That of his chambre he made hym a squier,
And gaf hym gold to mayntene his degree.
And eek men broghte hym out of his contree,
From yeer to yeer, ful pryvely his rente;
But honestly and slyly he it spente,
That no man wondred how that he it hadde.
And thre yeer in this <dfn data-note="manner">wise</dfn> his lif he ladde,
And bar hym so, in <dfn data-note="peace">pees</dfn> and eek in werre,
Ther was no man that Theseus <dfn data-note="holds dearer">hath derre</dfn>.
And in this blisse <dfn data-note="leave">lete</dfn> I now Arcite,
And speke I wole of Palamon a lite.
In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
Thise seven yeer hath seten Palamoun
<dfn data-note="wasted by suffering">Forpyned</dfn>, what for wo and for distresse.
Who feeleth double <dfn data-note="pain">soor</dfn> and <dfn data-note="sadness">hevynesse</dfn>
But Palamon, that love <dfn data-note="afflicts">destreyneth</dfn> so
That wood out of his wit he goth for wo?
And eek therto he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yer.
Who koude ryme in Englyssh proprely
His martirdom? For sothe it am nat I;
Therfore I passe as lightly as I may.
It fel that in the seventhe yer, of May
The thridde nyght (as olde bookes seyn,
That al this storie tellen moore pleyn),
Were it by <dfn data-note="chance or fate">aventure or destynee</dfn> —
As, whan a thyng is shapen, it shal be —
That soone after the mydnyght Palamoun,
By helpyng of a freend, brak his prisoun
And fleeth the citee faste as he may go.
For he hadde yeve his <dfn data-note="jailer">gayler</dfn> drynke so 
Of a <dfn data-note="a spiced and sweetened wine">clarree</dfn> maad of a certeyn wyn,
With nercotikes and <dfn data-note="opium">opie</dfn> of Thebes fyn,
That al that nyght, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The gayler <dfn data-note="slept">sleep</dfn>; he myghte nat awake.
And thus he <dfn data-note="flees, hastens">fleeth</dfn> as faste as evere he may.
The nyght was short and faste by the day
That <dfn data-note="necessarily">nedes cost</dfn> he moot hymselven hyde,
And til a grove <dfn data-note="close">faste</dfn> ther bisyde
With <dfn data-note="fearful">dredeful</dfn> foot thanne stalketh Palamon.
For, shortly, this was his opinion:
That in that grove he wolde hym hyde al day,
And in the nyght thanne wolde he take his way
To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
On Theseus to helpe him to <dfn data-note="wage war">werreye</dfn>;
And shortly, <dfn data-note="either">outher</dfn> he wolde lese his lif
Or wynnen Emelye unto his wyf.
This is <dfn data-note="the purpose">th’effect</dfn> and his entente pleyn.
Now wol I turne to Arcite ageyn,
That litel wiste how ny that was his care,
Til that Fortune had broght him in the snare.
The bisy larke, messager of day,
Salueth in hir song the morwe gray,
And firy Phebus riseth up so bright
That al the orient laugheth of the light,
And with his <dfn data-note="rays">stremes</dfn> dryeth in the <dfn data-note="groves">greves</dfn>
The silver dropes hangynge on the leves.
And Arcita, that in the court roial
With Theseus is squier principal,
Is risen and looketh on the myrie day.
And for to doon his observaunce to May,
Remembrynge on the poynt of his desir,
He on a <dfn data-note="war-horse, charger">courser</dfn>, <dfn data-note="leaping about">startlynge</dfn> as the fir,
Is riden into the feeldes hym to pleye,
Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye.
And to the grove of which that I yow tolde
By aventure his wey he <dfn data-note="did hold, held (took his way)">gan to holde</dfn>
To maken hym a gerland of the <dfn data-note="branches">greves</dfn>,
Were it of wodebynde or hawethorn leves,
And loude he song <dfn data-note="in the sun">ayeyn the sonne</dfn> shene:
"May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,
Welcome be thou, faire, fresshe May,
In hope that I <dfn data-note="something green">som grene</dfn> gete may."
And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
Into the grove ful hastily he <dfn data-note="rushed">sterte</dfn>,
And in a path he rometh up and doun,
Ther as by aventure this Palamoun
Was in a bussh, that no man myghte hym se,
For soore afered of his deeth was he.
No thyng ne knew he that it was Arcite;
God woot he wolde have trowed it ful lite.
But sooth is seyd, <dfn data-note="since many years ago">go sithen many yeres</dfn>,
That "feeld hath eyen and the wode hath eres."
It is ful fair a man to <dfn data-note="act calmly, moderately">bere hym evene</dfn>,
For al day <dfn data-note="people meet">meeteth men</dfn> <dfn data-note="with an unexpected (not set) time">at unset stevene</dfn>.
Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,
That was so ny to herknen al his <dfn data-note="speech">sawe</dfn>,
For in the bussh he sitteth now ful stille.
Whan that Arcite hadde romed al his fille,
And songen al the <dfn data-note="a short poetic and musical form; for an example, see PF 680-92.">roundel</dfn> lustily,
Into a studie he fil <dfn data-note="suddenly">sodeynly</dfn>,
As doon <dfn data-note="lovers in general">thise loveres</dfn> in hir <dfn data-note="strange manners">queynte geres</dfn>,
Now in the <dfn data-note="leaves (top)">crope</dfn>, now doun in the <dfn data-note="briars">breres</dfn>,
Now up, now doun, as <dfn data-note="bucket">boket</dfn> in a welle.
Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,
Right so kan <dfn data-note="fickle">geery</dfn> Venus <dfn data-note="sadden">overcaste</dfn>
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Is <dfn data-note="changeable">gereful</dfn>, right so chaungeth she array.
Selde is the Friday al the wowke ylike.
Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to <dfn data-note="sigh">sike</dfn>
And sette hym doun withouten any moore.
"Allas," quod he, "that day that I was bore!
How longe, Juno, thurgh thy crueltee,
Woltow <dfn data-note="wage war on">werreyen</dfn> Thebes the citee?
Allas, ybroght is to <dfn data-note="ruin">confusioun</dfn>
The blood roial of <dfn data-note="Cadmus and Amphion, founders of Thebes">Cadme and Amphioun</dfn> —
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
That Thebes bulte, <dfn data-note="ere">or</dfn> first the toun bigan,
And of the citee first was crouned kyng.
Of his lynage am I and his ofspryng
By <dfn data-note="true lineage">verray ligne</dfn>, as of the <dfn data-note="stock, family">stok</dfn> roial,
And now I am so <dfn data-note="wretched captive">caytyf</dfn> and so <dfn data-note="enslaved">thral</dfn>,
That he that is my mortal enemy,
I serve hym as his squier <dfn data-note="poor">povrely</dfn>.
And yet dooth Juno me wel moore shame,
For I dar noght <dfn data-note="acknowledge">biknowe</dfn> myn owene name;
But ther as I was wont to <dfn data-note="be called">highte</dfn> Arcite,
Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a <dfn data-note="a small Flemish coin of little value">myte</dfn>.
Allas, thou <dfn data-note="fierce">felle</dfn> Mars! Allas, Juno!
Thus hath youre ire oure lynage al <dfn data-note="destroyed">fordo</dfn>,
Save oonly me and wrecched Palamoun,
That Theseus <dfn data-note="torments">martireth</dfn> in prisoun.
And over al this, to <dfn data-note="slay, kill">sleen</dfn> me outrely
Love hath his firy dart so <dfn data-note="ardently">brennyngly</dfn>
<dfn data-note="struck, stabbed">Ystiked</dfn> thurgh my <dfn data-note="faithful">trewe</dfn>, <dfn data-note="sorrowful">careful</dfn> herte
That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.
Ye sleen me with youre eyen, Emelye!
Ye been the cause wherfore that I dye.
Of al the remenant of myn oother care
Ne sette I nat the <dfn data-note="amount, value">montance</dfn> of a <dfn data-note="weed (i.e., nothing)">tare</dfn>,
So that I koude doon aught to youre <dfn data-note="pleasure">plesaunce</dfn>."
And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
A longe tyme, and after he up sterte.
This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
He felte a coold swerd sodeynliche glyde,
For ire he <dfn data-note="trembled">quook</dfn>; no lenger wolde he byde.
And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
As he were wood, with face deed and pale,
He stirte hym up out of the <dfn data-note="bushes">buskes</dfn> thikke
And seide: "Arcite, false traytour <dfn data-note="wicked">wikke</dfn>,
Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,
For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,
And art my blood, and to my conseil sworn,
As I ful ofte have told thee heerbiforn,
And hast <dfn data-note="tricked">byjaped</dfn> heere duc Theseus,
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus!
I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.
Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,
But I wol love hire oonly and <dfn data-note="no others">namo</dfn>;
For I am Palamon, thy mortal foo.
And though that I no <dfn data-note="weapons">wepene</dfn> have in this place,
But out of prison am <dfn data-note="escaped">astert</dfn> by grace,
I <dfn data-note="doube">drede</dfn> noght that <dfn data-note="either">outher</dfn> thow shalt dye,
Or thow ne shalt nat loven Emelye.
<dfn data-note="choose">Chees</dfn> which thou wolt, or thou shalt nat asterte!"
This Arcite, with ful <dfn data-note="scornful">despitous</dfn> herte,
Whan he hym knew, and hadde his tale herd,
As fiers as leon pulled out his swerd,
And seyde thus: "By God that <dfn data-note="sittetb, sits">sit</dfn> above,
Nere it that thou art <dfn data-note="sick">sik</dfn> and wood for love,
And eek that thow no wepne hast in this place,
Thou sholdest nevere out of this grove pace,
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.
For I <dfn data-note="repudiate">defye</dfn> the <dfn data-note="pledge">seurete</dfn> and the bond
Which that thou seist that I have maad to thee.
<dfn data-note="an exclamation">What!</dfn> Verray fool, thynk wel that love is free,
And I wol love hire <dfn data-note="in spite of">maugree</dfn> al thy myght!
But for as muche thou art a worthy knyght
And <dfn data-note="desire">wilnest</dfn> to <dfn data-note="decide the right to her">darreyne hire</dfn> by bataille,
Have heer my <dfn data-note="pledge">trouthe</dfn>; tomorwe I wol nat faille,
Withoute <dfn data-note="knowledge">wityng</dfn> of any oother wight,

And bryngen <dfn data-note="armor">harneys</dfn> right ynough for thee;
And ches the beste, and <dfn data-note="leave">leef</dfn> the worste for me.
And mete and drynke this nyght wol I brynge
Ynough for thee, and clothes for thy beddynge.
And if so be that thou my lady wynne,
And sle me in this wode <dfn data-note="where">ther</dfn> I am inne,
Thow mayst wel have thy lady as for me."
This Palamon answerde, "I <dfn data-note="agree">graunte it thee</dfn>."
And thus they been departed til amorwe,
Whan ech of hem had leyd his feith <dfn data-note="as a pledge">to borwe</dfn>.
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd that love ne lordshipe
Wol noght, <dfn data-note="willingly">his thankes</dfn>, have no <dfn data-note="equal partnership">felaweshipe</dfn>.
Wel fynden that Arcite and Palamoun.
Arcite is riden anon unto the toun,
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
Ful prively <dfn data-note="two suits of armor">two harneys</dfn> hath he <dfn data-note="prepared">dight</dfn>,
Bothe suffisaunt and <dfn data-note="suitable, fitting">mete</dfn> to <dfn data-note="engage in, decide the battle">darreyne</dfn>
<dfn data-note="engage in, decide the battle">The bataille</dfn> in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne;
And on his hors, allone as he was born,
He carieth al the harneys hym biforn.
And in the grove, at tyme and place yset,
This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.
To chaungen gan the colour in hir face;
Right as the hunters in the <dfn data-note="kingdom of Thrace">regne of Trace</dfn>,
That stondeth at the <dfn data-note="gap (toward which the game is driven)">gappe</dfn> with a spere,
Whan hunted is the leon or the bere,
And hereth hym come russhyng in the greves,
And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
And thynketh, "Heere cometh my mortal enemy!
Withoute faille, he moot be deed, or I,
For outher I moot sleen hym at the gappe,
Or he moot sleen me, if that <dfn data-note="I should suffer misfortune">me myshappe</dfn>."
So ferden they in chaungyng of hir hewe,
As fer as everich of hem oother knewe.
Ther nas no good day, ne no <dfn data-note="greeting">saluyng</dfn>,
But streight, withouten word or <dfn data-note="conversation">rehersyng</dfn>,
Everich of hem heelp for to armen oother
As freendly as he were his owene brother;
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge
They <dfn data-note="thrust">foynen</dfn> <dfn data-note="at each other">ech at oother</dfn> wonder longe.
Thou myghtest <dfn data-note="suppose">wene</dfn> that this Palamon
In his fightyng were a wood leon,
And as a crueel tigre was Arcite;
As wilde <dfn data-note="boars">bores</dfn> gonne they to smyte,
That <dfn data-note="foam at the mouth">frothen</dfn> whit as foom for ire wood.
Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.
And in this wise I lete hem fightyng dwelle,
And forth I wole of Theseus yow telle.
The destinee, ministre general,
That <dfn data-note="administers">executeth</dfn> in the world over al
The <dfn data-note="foresight, providence">purveiaunce</dfn> that God hath seyn biforn,
So strong it is that, though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thyng by ye or nay,
Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day
That falleth nat <dfn data-note="again">eft</dfn> withinne a thousand yeer.
For certeinly, oure appetites heer,
Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
Al is this reuled by the <dfn data-note="foresight">sighte</dfn> above.
This <dfn data-note="say">mene</dfn> I now <dfn data-note="concerning">by</dfn> myghty Theseus,
That for to hunten is so desirus,
And namely at the <dfn data-note="large hart, worthy of hunting">grete hert</dfn> in May,
That in his bed ther <dfn data-note="dawns for him">daweth hym</dfn> no day
That he nys clad, and redy for to ryde
With <dfn data-note="huntsman">hunte</dfn> and horn and houndes hym bisyde.
For in his huntyng hath he swich delit
That it is al his joye and appetit
To been hymself the grete hertes <dfn data-note="killer">bane</dfn>,
For <dfn data-note="next to Mars, the god of war">after Mars</dfn> he serveth now <dfn data-note="Diana, goddess of hunting">Dyane</dfn>.
Cleer was the day, as I have toold er this,
And Theseus with alle joye and blis,
With his Ypolita, the faire queene,
And Emelye, clothed al in grene,
On huntyng be they riden roially.
And to the grove that stood <dfn data-note="very close by">ful faste by</dfn>,
In which ther was an hert, as men hym tolde,
Duc Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.
And to the launde he rideth hym ful right,
For <dfn data-note="thither, there">thider</dfn> was the hert wont have his flight,
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.
This duc wol han a <dfn data-note="run">cours</dfn> at hym or tweye
With houndes swiche as that hym list comaunde.
And whan this duc was come unto the <dfn data-note="clearing">launde</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="in the direction of the sun">Under the sonne</dfn> he looketh, and anon
He was war of Arcite and Palamon,
That foughten <dfn data-note="fiercely">breme</dfn> as it were bores two.
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro
So hidously that with the leeste strook
It semed as it wolde felle an ook.
But what they were, no thyng he ne woot.
This duc his courser with his spores smoot,
And <dfn data-note="with a sudden movement, instantly">at a stert</dfn> he was bitwix hem two,
And pulled out a swerd and cride, "<dfn data-note="stop!">Hoo!</dfn>
Namoore, <dfn data-note="on the penalty of">up peyne of</dfn> lesynge of youre heed!
By myghty Mars, he shal anon be deed
That smyteth any strook that I may seen.
But telleth me <dfn data-note="what sort of men">what myster men</dfn> ye been,
That been so hardy for to fighten heere
Withouten <dfn data-note="judge or some other officer, as in a properly conducted legal duel (in a lystes roially)">juge or oother officere</dfn>,
As it were in a lystes roially."
This Palamon answerde hastily
And seyde, "Sire, what nedeth wordes mo?
We have the deeth disserved bothe two.
Two woful wrecches been we, two <dfn data-note="wretches">caytyves</dfn>,
That been <dfn data-note="burdened">encombred</dfn> of oure owene lyves;
And as thou art a rightful lord and juge,
Ne yif us neither mercy ne refuge,
But sle me first, <dfn data-note="by holy charity (seine is pronounced with two syllables)">for seinte charitee</dfn>!
But sle my felawe eek as wel as me;
Or sle hym first, for though thow knowest it lite,
This is thy mortal foo, this is Arcite,
That fro thy lond is banysshed on his heed,
For which he hath deserved to be deed.
For this is he that cam unto thy gate
And seyde that he highte Philostrate.
Thus hath he <dfn data-note="tricked">japed</dfn> thee ful many a yer,
And thou hast maked hym thy chief squier;
And this is he that loveth Emelye.
For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
I make pleynly my confessioun
That I am <dfn data-note="that">thilke</dfn> woful Palamoun
That hath thy prisoun broken wikkedly.
I am thy mortal foo, and it am I
That loveth so <dfn data-note="passionately">hoote</dfn> Emelye the brighte
That I wol dye present in hir sighte.
Wherfore I <dfn data-note="ask">axe</dfn> deeth and my <dfn data-note="judicial sentence">juwise</dfn>;
But sle my felawe in the same wise,
For bothe han we deserved to be slayn."
This worthy duc answerde anon agayn,
And seyde, "This is a short conclusioun.
Youre owene mouth, by youre confessioun,
Hath <dfn data-note="condemned">dampned</dfn> yow, and I wol it <dfn data-note="pronounce">recorde</dfn>;
It nedeth noght <dfn data-note="to torture you (to force a confession) with a cord (twisted about your heads)">to pyne yow with the corde</dfn>.
Ye shal be deed, by myghty Mars the rede!"
The queene anon, for verray <dfn data-note="womanliness (having the qualities proper to a woman)">wommanhede</dfn>,
Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
And alle the ladyes in the compaignye.
Greet pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
That evere swich a chaunce sholde falle,
For gentil men they were of greet estaat,
And no thyng but for love was this debaat;
And saugh hir blody woundes wyde and soore,
And alle crieden, bothe lasse and moore,
"Have mercy, Lord, upon us wommen alle!"
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle 
And wolde have kist his feet ther as he stood;
Til at the laste <dfn data-note="calmed">aslaked</dfn> was his mood,
For pitee <dfn data-note="moves">renneth</dfn> soone in gentil herte.
And though he first for ire <dfn data-note="shook">quook</dfn> and <dfn data-note="trembled">sterte</dfn>,
He hath considered shortly, <dfn data-note="briefly">in a clause</dfn>,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause,
And although that his ire hir gilt accused,
Yet in his resoun he hem bothe excused,
As thus: he thoghte wel that every man
Wol helpe hymself in love, if that he kan,
And eek delivere hymself out of prisoun.
And eek his herte hadde compassioun
Of wommen, for they wepen <dfn data-note="continually">evere in oon</dfn>,
And in his gentil herte he thoughte anon,
And <dfn data-note="quietly">softe</dfn> unto hymself he seyde, "Fy
Upon a lord that wol have no mercy,
But been a leon, bothe in word and dede,
To hem that been in repentaunce and drede,
As wel as to a proud despitous man
That wol <dfn data-note="persist in">mayntene</dfn> that he first bigan.
That lord hath litel of <dfn data-note="sound judgment">discrecioun</dfn>,
That in swich cas <dfn data-note="knows no distinctions">kan no divisioun</dfn>
But <dfn data-note="weighs">weyeth</dfn> pride and humblesse <dfn data-note="alike">after oon</dfn>."
And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
He gan to looken up with eyen lighte
And spak thise same wordes al <dfn data-note="aloud">on highte</dfn>:
"The god of love, a <dfn data-note="(the Lord) bless you">benedicite</dfn>!
How myghty and how greet a lord is he!
Ayeyns his myght ther <dfn data-note="avail">gayneth</dfn> none obstacles.
He may be cleped a god for his myracles,
For he kan maken, <dfn data-note="after his own fashion">at his owene gyse</dfn>,
Of everich herte as that hym list <dfn data-note="command">divyse</dfn>.
Lo heere this Arcite and this Palamoun,
That <dfn data-note="freely">quitly</dfn> weren out of my prisoun,
And myghte han lyved in Thebes roially,
And <dfn data-note="know">witen</dfn> I am hir mortal enemy,
And that hir deth lith in my myght also,
And yet hath love, <dfn data-note="in spite of">maugree</dfn> hir eyen two,
Broght hem hyder bothe for to dye.
Now looketh, is nat that an heigh folye?
Who may been a fool but if he love?
Bihoold, for Goddes sake that <dfn data-note="sitteth, sits">sit</dfn> above,
Se how they blede! Be they noght wel arrayed?
Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, <dfn data-note="paid">ypayed</dfn>
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
And yet they <dfn data-note="think themselves">wenen for to been</dfn> ful wyse
That serven love, for aught that may bifalle.
But this is yet the beste <dfn data-note="joke">game</dfn> of alle,
That she for whom they han this <dfn data-note="passion">jolitee</dfn>
Kan hem therfore as muche thank as me.
She woot namoore of al this <dfn data-note="rash conduct">hoote fare</dfn>,
By God, than woot a <dfn data-note="cuckoo">cokkow</dfn> or an hare!
But all moot ben <dfn data-note="experienced">assayed</dfn>, hoot and coold;
A man moot ben a fool, or yong or oold —
I woot it by myself ful <dfn data-note="long ago">yore agon</dfn>,
For in my tyme a <dfn data-note="servant of Love, lover">servant</dfn> was I oon.
And therfore, syn I knowe of loves peyne
And woot hou soore it kan a man <dfn data-note="afflict">distreyne</dfn>,
As he that hath ben caught ofte in his <dfn data-note="snare">laas</dfn>,
I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespaas,
At requeste of the queene, that kneleth heere,
And eek of Emelye, my suster deere.
And ye <dfn data-note="must">shul</dfn> bothe anon unto me swere
That nevere mo ye shal my contree <dfn data-note="harm">dere</dfn>,
Ne make werre upon me nyght ne day,
But been my freendes in all that ye may.
I yow foryeve this trespas <dfn data-note="completely">every deel</dfn>."
And they hym sworen his axyng faire and weel,
And hym <dfn data-note="to be their lord, protector">of lordshipe</dfn> and of mercy preyde,
And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde:
"To speke of roial lynage and <dfn data-note="wealth">richesse</dfn>,
Though that she were a queene or a princesse,
Ech of you bothe is worthy, doutelees,
To wedden whan tyme is; but <dfn data-note="none the less">nathelees</dfn> —
I speke as for my suster Emelye,
For whom ye have this strif and jalousye —
Ye woot yourself she may nat wedden two
<dfn data-note="at once, at the same time">Atones</dfn>, though ye fighten everemo,
That oon of you, <dfn data-note="whether he likes it or not">al be hym looth or lief</dfn>,
He moot go pipen in an yvy leef;
This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
Al be ye never so jalouse ne so <dfn data-note="angr&#x27;">wrothe</dfn>. 
And <dfn data-note="therelore">forthy</dfn> I yow putte in this <dfn data-note="situation">degree</dfn>,
That ech of yow shal have his destynee
As hym is shape, and herkneth in what <dfn data-note="manner">wyse</dfn>;
Lo, heere youre ende of that I shal devyse.
My wyl is this, for <dfn data-note="flat, blunt">plat</dfn> conclusioun,
Withouten any <dfn data-note="reply">repplicacioun</dfn> —
If that you liketh, take it for the beste:
That everich of you shal goon where hym leste
Frely, withouten raunson or <dfn data-note="resistance">daunger</dfn>,
And this day fifty wykes, <dfn data-note="more or less; see n.">fer ne ner</dfn>,
Everich of you shal brynge an hundred knyghtes
Armed <dfn data-note="for battle in the lists">for lystes</dfn> up <dfn data-note="in all respects">at alle rightes</dfn>,
Al redy to <dfn data-note="decide the right to her">darreyne hire</dfn> by bataille.
And this <dfn data-note="promise">bihote</dfn> I yow withouten faille,
Upon my trouthe, and as I ama knyght,
That <dfn data-note="whichever">wheither</dfn> of yow bothe that hath myght —
This is to seyn, that wheither he or thow
May with his hundred, as I spak of now,
Sleen his contrarie, or out of lystes dryve,
Thanne shal I yeve Emelya <dfn data-note="as a wife">to wyve</dfn>
To whom that Fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
The lystes shal I maken in this place,
And God so wisly on my soule <dfn data-note="have mercy">rewe</dfn>
As I shal <dfn data-note="impartial">evene</dfn> juge been and trewe.
Ye <dfn data-note="shall">shul</dfn> noon oother ende with me maken,
That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
And if yow thynketh this is weel ysayd,
Seyeth youre <dfn data-note="opinion">avys</dfn>, and holdeth you <dfn data-note="satisfied">apayd</dfn>.
This is youre ende and youre conclusioun."
Who looketh <dfn data-note="cheerfully">lightly</dfn> now but Palamoun?
Who spryngeth up for joye but Arcite?
Who kouthe telle, or who kouthe it <dfn data-note="describe in writin,">endite</dfn>,
The joye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath <dfn data-note="behaved so graciously">doon so fair a grace</dfn>?
But doun on knees wente every maner wight,
And thonked hym with al hir herte and myght,
And namely the Thebans often sithe.
And thus with good hope and with herte blithe
They taken hir leve, and homward gonne they ride
To Thebes with his olde walles wyde.
<div class="special-line"><dfn data-note="Here ends the second part.">Explicit secunda pars</dfn></div>
<div class="special-line"><dfn data-note="Here follows the third part.">Sequitur pars tercia</dfn></div>
I trowe men wolde deme it necligence
If I foryete to tellen the <dfn data-note="expenditures">dispence</dfn>
Of Theseus, that gooth so bisily
To maken up the lystes roially,
That swich a noble theatre as it was
I dar wel seyen in this world ther nas.
The circuit a myle was aboute,
Walled of stoon, and <dfn data-note="surrounded by a ditch">dyched</dfn> al withoute.
Round was the shap, in <dfn data-note="the shape of a circle">manere of compas</dfn>,
Ful of <dfn data-note="tiers, rows of seats">degrees</dfn>, the heighte of sixty <dfn data-note="paces">pas</dfn>, 
That whan a man was set on o degree,
He <dfn data-note="hindered">letted</dfn> nat his felawe for to see.
Estward ther stood a gate of marbul whit,
Westward right swich another in the opposit.
And shortly to concluden, swich a place 
Was noon in erthe, as in so litel <dfn data-note="time">space</dfn>;
For in the lond ther was no <dfn data-note="skillful, ingenious">crafty</dfn> man
That geometrie or <dfn data-note="art of measurement (arithmetic)">ars-metrike</dfn> <dfn data-note="knows">kan</dfn>,
Ne <dfn data-note="painter">portreyour</dfn>, ne <dfn data-note="sculptor">kervere of ymages</dfn>,
That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages
The theatre for to maken and <dfn data-note="contrive">devyse</dfn>.
And for to doon his ryte and sacrifise,
He estward hath, upon the gate above,
In worshipe of Venus, goddesse of love,
Doon make an <dfn data-note="altar">auter</dfn> and an <dfn data-note="shrine, chapel">oratorie</dfn>;
And on the gate westward, in memorie
Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
That coste largely of gold a <dfn data-note="cartload">fother</dfn>.
And northward, in a <dfn data-note="turret">touret</dfn> on the wal,
Of alabastre whit and reed coral,
An oratorie, riche for to see,
In worshipe of <dfn data-note="the chaste Diana">Dyane of chastitee</dfn>,
Hath Theseus <dfn data-note="had made">doon wroght</dfn> in noble wyse.
But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
The noble <dfn data-note="sculpture">kervyng</dfn> and the <dfn data-note="paintings">portreitures</dfn>,
The shap, the <dfn data-note="appearance">contenaunce</dfn>, and the figures
That weren in thise oratories thre.
First in the temple of Venus maystow se
Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
The broken slepes, and the <dfn data-note="sighs">sikes</dfn> colde,
The sacred teeris, and the <dfn data-note="lamentation">waymentynge</dfn>,
The firy strokes of the desirynge
That loves servantz in this lyf enduren;
The othes that hir <dfn data-note="agreements">covenantz</dfn> assuren;
<dfn data-note="Pleasure, amusement">Plesaunce</dfn> and Hope, Desir, Foolhardynesse,
Beautee and Youthe, <dfn data-note="Mirth, jollity">Bauderie</dfn>, Richesse,
Charmes and Force, <dfn data-note="Falsehood, deceit">Lesynges</dfn>, Flaterye,
<dfn data-note="expenditures">Despense</dfn>, <dfn data-note="attentiveness">Bisynesse</dfn>, and Jalousye,
That wered of <dfn data-note="yellow">yelewe</dfn> <dfn data-note="marigolds">gooldes</dfn> a gerland,
And a <dfn data-note="cuckoo (a symbol of cuckoldry)">cokkow</dfn> sittynge on hir hand;
Festes, instrumentz, <dfn data-note="dance-songs">caroles</dfn>, daunces,
Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
Of love, which that I rekned and rekne shal,
<dfn data-note="sequentially">By ordre</dfn> weren peynted on the wal,
And mo than I kan make of mencioun.
For soothly al the mount of <dfn data-note="Cithaeron, here confused with the island Cytherea">Citheroun</dfn>,
Ther Venus hath hir principal dwellynge,
Was shewed on the wal in portreyynge,
With al the gardyn and the <dfn data-note="pleasure">lustynesse</dfn>.
Nat was foryeten the porter, Ydelnesse,
Ne <dfn data-note="Narcissus, for whom the nymph Echo died; for the story, see Rom 1469-1638.">Narcisus</dfn> the faire of yore agon,
Ne yet the <dfn data-note="lechery">folye</dfn> of kyng <dfn data-note="Solomon, who had many wives">Salomon</dfn>,
Ne yet the grete strengthe of <dfn data-note="Hercules, whose beloved killed him; see MkT VII.2095-142.">Ercules</dfn> —
Th’enchauntementz of <dfn data-note="famous sorceresses, who tried to hold their loves by magic">Medea and Circes</dfn> —
Ne of <dfn data-note="whose love for Lavinia led to his fatal duel with Aeneas; cf. HF 457-58.">Turnus</dfn>, with the hardy fiers corage,
The riche <dfn data-note="Croesus, wretched in captivity; see MkT VII.2727-66.">Cresus, kaytyf in servage</dfn>.
Thus may ye seen that wysdom ne richesse,
Beautee ne <dfn data-note="trickery">sleighte</dfn>, strengthe ne <dfn data-note="bravery">hardynesse</dfn>,
Ne may with Venus holde <dfn data-note="parmership in power">champartie</dfn>,
For as hir list the world than may she <dfn data-note="rule">gye</dfn>.
Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir <dfn data-note="snare">las</dfn>,
Til they for wo ful ofte seyde "allas!"
Suffiseth heere ensamples oon or two,
And though I koude rekene a thousand mo.
The statue of Venus, glorious for to se,
Was naked, <dfn data-note="floating">fletynge</dfn> in the large see,
And fro the navele doun al covered was
With <dfn data-note="waves">wawes</dfn> grene, and brighte as any glas.
A <dfn data-note="a stringed instrument, like a zither">citole</dfn> in hir right hand hadde she,
And on hir heed, ful semely for to se,
A rose gerland, fressh and wel smellynge;
Above hir heed hir dowves <dfn data-note="fluttering">flikerynge</dfn>.
Biforn hire stood hir sone Cupido;
Upon his shuldres wynges hadde he two,
And blynd he was, as it is often seene;
A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.
Why sholde I noght as wel <dfn data-note="also">eek</dfn> telle yow al
The portreiture that was upon the wal
Withinne the temple of myghty Mars the rede?
Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and <dfn data-note="breadth">brede</dfn>,
Lyk to the <dfn data-note="interior apartments">estres</dfn> of the grisly place
That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
In thilke colde, frosty regioun
Ther as Mars hath his <dfn data-note="best, most excellent">sovereyn</dfn> mansioun.
First on the wal was peynted a forest, 
In which ther dwelleth neither man ne best,
With knotty, <dfn data-note="gnarled">knarry</dfn>, <dfn data-note="barren">bareyne</dfn> trees olde,
Of <dfn data-note="stumps">stubbes</dfn> sharpe and hidouse to biholde,
In which ther ran a <dfn data-note="rumbling noise">rumbel</dfn> in a <dfn data-note="sound of wind">swough</dfn>,
As though a storm sholde <dfn data-note="burst">bresten</dfn> every bough.
And dounward from an hille, <dfn data-note="close to">under</dfn> a <dfn data-note="grassy slope">bente</dfn>,
Ther stood the temple of Mars <dfn data-note="powerful in arms">armypotente</dfn>,
Wroght al of <dfn data-note="burnished">burned</dfn> steel, of which the entree
Was long and <dfn data-note="narrow, small">streit</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="terrifying">gastly</dfn> for to see.
And therout came a <dfn data-note="rush of wind">rage</dfn> and swich a <dfn data-note="rush, blast">veze</dfn>
That it made al the gate for to <dfn data-note="shake">rese</dfn>.
The <dfn data-note="light from the north">northren lyght</dfn> in at the dores shoon,
For wyndowe on the wal ne was ther noon,
Thurgh which men myghten any light discerne.
The dore was al of <dfn data-note="the hardest of stones">adamant</dfn> eterne,
<dfn data-note="bound, clinched">Yclenched</dfn> <dfn data-note="crosswise">overthwart</dfn> and <dfn data-note="lengthwise">endelong</dfn>
With iren tough; and for to make it strong,
Every <dfn data-note="pillar">pyler</dfn>, the temple to <dfn data-note="sustain, support">sustene</dfn>,
Was <dfn data-note="big around as a large barrel">tonne-greet</dfn>, of iren bright and shene.
Ther saugh I first the <dfn data-note="malicious plotting">derke ymaginyng</dfn>
Of <dfn data-note="Wickedness">Felonye</dfn>, and al the <dfn data-note="scheming">compassyng</dfn>;
The crueel Ire, reed as any <dfn data-note="glowing coal">gleede</dfn>;
The <dfn data-note="pick-purse, thief">pykepurs</dfn>, and eek the pale <dfn data-note="Fear">Drede</dfn>;
The smylere with the knyf under the cloke;
The <dfn data-note="stable">shepne</dfn> brennynge with the blake smoke;
The tresoun of the <dfn data-note="murder">mordrynge</dfn> in the bedde;
The open werre, <dfn data-note="all covered with blood from wounds">with woundes al bibledde</dfn>;
<dfn data-note="strife">Contek</dfn>, with blody knyf and sharp manace.
Al ful of <dfn data-note="groaning, creaking">chirkyng</dfn> was that <dfn data-note="sorry, wretched">sory</dfn> place.
The <dfn data-note="slayer">sleere</dfn> of hymself yet saugh I ther —
His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer —
The nayl ydryven in the <dfn data-note="parting of the hair, temple">shode</dfn> anyght,
The colde deeth, with mouth gapyng <dfn data-note="upwards">upright</dfn>.
Amyddes of the temple sat <dfn data-note="Misfortune">Meschaunce</dfn>,
With disconfort and sory contenaunce.
Yet saugh I <dfn data-note="Madness">Woodnesse</dfn>, laughynge in his rage,

A thousand slayn, and nat <dfn data-note="killed by the plague">of qualm ystorve</dfn>;
The tiraunt, with the <dfn data-note="prey">pray</dfn> by force <dfn data-note="taken away">yraft</dfn>,
The toun destroyed, ther was no thyng laft.
Yet saugh I <dfn data-note="burned">brent</dfn> the shippes <dfn data-note="dancing (on a stormy sea)">hoppesteres</dfn>;
The <dfn data-note="hunter">hunte</dfn> <dfn data-note="killed by">strangled with</dfn> the wilde beres;
The sowe <dfn data-note="devour">freten</dfn> the child right in the cradel;
The cook yscalded, <dfn data-note="despite his long-handled spoon">for al his longe ladel</dfn>.
Noght was foryeten by the <dfn data-note="evil influence of Mars">infortune of Marte</dfn>.
The cartere <dfn data-note="run over by">overryden with</dfn> his carte —
Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
Ther were also, of <dfn data-note="those influenced by Mars">Martes divisioun</dfn>,
The barbour, and the <dfn data-note="butcher">bocher</dfn>, and the smyth,
That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his <dfn data-note="anvil">styth</dfn>.
And al above, <dfn data-note="painted">depeynted</dfn> in a tour,
Saugh I Conquest, sittynge in greet honour,
With the sharpe swerd over his heed
Hangynge by a <dfn data-note="thin thread of twine">soutil twynes threed</dfn>.
Depeynted was the slaughtre of <dfn data-note="the Roman emperors">Julius,</dfn>
<dfn data-note="the Roman emperors">Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;</dfn>
Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,
Yet was hir deth depeynted ther-biforn
By <dfn data-note="menace, threat">manasynge</dfn> of Mars, right <dfn data-note="according to the configuration of the planets; &quot;perhaps a technical reference to a horoscope&quot; (R.)">by figure</dfn>;
So was it shewed in that <dfn data-note="painting">portreiture</dfn>,
As is depeynted in the sterres above
Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.
Suffiseth oon <dfn data-note="illustrative story">ensample</dfn> in <dfn data-note="histories">stories</dfn> olde;
I may nat rekene hem alle though I wolde.
The statue of Mars upon a <dfn data-note="chariot">carte</dfn> stood
Armed, and looked grym as he were wood;
And over his heed ther shynen two figures
Of sterres, that been cleped in <dfn data-note="books">scriptures</dfn>,
That oon Puella, that oother <dfn data-note="figures in geomancy; see n.">Rubeus</dfn>—
This god of armes was arrayed thus.
A wolf ther stood biforn hym at his feet
With eyen rede, and of a man he <dfn data-note="ate">eet</dfn>;
With soutil pencel was depeynted this storie
In redoutynge of Mars and of his glorie.
Now to the temple of Dyane the chaste,
As shortly as I kan, I wol me haste,
To telie yow al the descripsioun.
Depeynted been the walles up and doun
Of huntyng and of <dfn data-note="modest">shamefast</dfn> chastitee.
Ther saugh I how woful <dfn data-note="Callisto, who was metamorphosed into Ursa Major">Calistopee</dfn>,
Whan that Diane <dfn data-note="angered">agreved</dfn> was with here,
Was turned from a womman til a bere,
And after was she maad the <dfn data-note="polestar, North star">loode-sterre</dfn>.
Thus was it peynted; I kan sey yow no <dfn data-note="further">ferre</dfn>.
Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.
Ther saugh I <dfn data-note="Daphne, pursued by Apollo and metamorphosed into the laurel tree">Dane</dfn>, yturned til a tree —
I mene nat the goddesse Diane,
But Penneus doghter, which that highte Dane.
Ther saugh I <dfn data-note="Actaeon, metamorphosed into a hart by Diana">Attheon</dfn> an hert ymaked,
For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;
I saugh how that his houndes have hym caught
And <dfn data-note="devoured">freeten</dfn> hym, for that they knewe hym naught.
Yet peynted was a litel forther moor
How <dfn data-note="Atalanta, for whom Meleager (Meleagre ) hunted the Calydonian boar; see Tr 5.1464-84.">Atthalante</dfn> hunted the wilde boor,
And Meleagre, and many another mo,
For which Dyane wroghte hym care and wo.
Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
The which me list nat drawen to memorie.
This goddesse on an hert ful hye <dfn data-note="sat">seet</dfn>,
With smale houndes al aboute hir feet,
And undernethe hir feet she hadde a moone —
<dfn data-note="waxing">Wexynge</dfn> it was and sholde <dfn data-note="wane">wanye</dfn> soone.
In <dfn data-note="yellowish">gaude</dfn> grene hir statue clothed was,
With bowe in honde and arwes in a cas.
Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun
Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
A womman <dfn data-note="in labor">travaillynge</dfn> was hire biforn;
But for hir child so longe was unborn,
Ful pitously <dfn data-note="Lucina, Diana as goddess of childbirth">Lucyna</dfn> gan she calle
And seyde, "Help, for <dfn data-note="you are best able, have most power">thou mayst best</dfn> of alle!"
Wel koude he peynten lifly that it wroghte;
With many a <dfn data-note="florin, a gold coin">floryn</dfn> he the <dfn data-note="pigments">hewes</dfn> boghte.
Now been thise lystes maad, and Theseus,
That at his grete cost <dfn data-note="prepared">arrayed</dfn> thus
The temples and the theatre <dfn data-note="in all respects">every deel</dfn>,
Whan it was doon, hym lyked wonder weel.
But stynte I wole of Theseus a lite,
And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
The day approcheth of hir retournynge,
That everich sholde an hundred knyghtes brynge
The bataille to <dfn data-note="decide">darreyne</dfn>, as I yow tolde.
And til Atthenes, hir covenant for to holde,
Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knyghtes,
Wel armed for the werre <dfn data-note="in all respects">at alle rightes</dfn>.
And <dfn data-note="truly">sikerly</dfn> ther <dfn data-note="believed">trowed</dfn> many a man
That nevere, sithen that the world bigan,
As for to speke of knyghthod <dfn data-note="of the deeds of their hand, their prowess">of hir hond</dfn>,
As fer as God hath maked see or lond,
Nas of so fewe so noble a compaignye.
For every wight that lovede chivalrye
And wolde, <dfn data-note="willingly">his thankes</dfn>, han a <dfn data-note="outstanding reputation">passant name</dfn>,
Hath preyed that he myghte been of that game;
And wel was hym that therto chosen was,
For if ther fille tomorwe swich a cas,
Ye knowen wel that every lusty knyght
That loveth <dfn data-note="passionately">paramours</dfn> and hath his myght,
Were it in Engelond or elleswhere,
They wolde, hir thankes, <dfn data-note="desire">wilnen</dfn> to be there —
To fighte for a lady, benedicitee!
It were a <dfn data-note="pleasing">lusty</dfn> sighte for to see.
And right so ferden they with Palamon.
With hym ther wenten knyghtes many on;
<dfn data-note="a certain one">Som</dfn> wol ben armed in an <dfn data-note="coat of mail">haubergeoun</dfn>,
And in a brestplate and a light <dfn data-note="tunic">gypoun</dfn>;
And som wol have a <dfn data-note="set of plate armor">paire plates</dfn> large;
And som wol have a <dfn data-note="Prussian">Pruce</dfn> sheeld or a targe;
Som wol ben armed on his legges weel,
And have an ax, and som a mace of steel —
Ther is no newe gyse that it nas old.
Armed were they, as I have yow told,
Everych <dfn data-note="according to">after</dfn> his opinioun.
Ther maistow seen, comynge with Palamoun,
<dfn data-note="Lycurgus">Lygurge</dfn> hymself, the grete kyng of Trace.
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face;
The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixen yelow and reed,
And lik a <dfn data-note="griffin (mythical beast with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle)">grifphon</dfn> looked he aboute,
With <dfn data-note="shaggy">kempe</dfn> heeris on his browes stoute;
His <dfn data-note="large limbs">lymes grete</dfn>, his <dfn data-note="muscles">brawnes</dfn> harde and stronge,
His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe;
And as the gyse was in his contree,
Ful hye upon a <dfn data-note="chariot">chaar</dfn> of gold stood he,
With foure white <dfn data-note="bulls">boles</dfn> in the <dfn data-note="traces, harness">trays</dfn>.
In stede of <dfn data-note="a tunic embroidered with a heraldic device, worn over the armor">cote-armure</dfn> over his harnays,
With <dfn data-note="rivets">nayles</dfn> <dfn data-note="yellow">yelewe</dfn> and brighte as any gold,
He hadde a beres skyn, <dfn data-note="coal-black">col-blak</dfn> <dfn data-note="because of age">for old</dfn>.
His longe heer was <dfn data-note="combed">kembd</dfn> bihynde his bak;
As any ravenes fethere it shoon <dfn data-note="because of blackness">for blak</dfn>;
A wrethe of gold, <dfn data-note="thick as an arm">arm-greet</dfn>, of huge <dfn data-note="weight">wighte</dfn>,
Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
Of fyne rubyes and of <dfn data-note="diamonds">dyamauntz</dfn>.
Aboute his chaar ther wenten white <dfn data-note="wolfhounds">alauntz</dfn>,
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,
And folwed hym with <dfn data-note="muzzle">mosel</dfn> faste ybounde,
<dfn data-note="wearing collars">Colered</dfn> of gold, and <dfn data-note="rings for leashes">tourettes</dfn> <dfn data-note="smoothed">fyled</dfn> rounde.
An hundred lordes hadde he in his <dfn data-note="company">route</dfn>,
Armed ful wel, with hertes <dfn data-note="stern, cruel">stierne</dfn> and stoute.
With Arcita, in stories as men fynde,
The grete Emetreus, the kyng of <dfn data-note="India">Inde</dfn>,
Upon a steede <dfn data-note="reddish-brown">bay</dfn> <dfn data-note="equipped with trappings">trapped</dfn> in steel,
Covered in clooth of gold, <dfn data-note="decorated with small geometric patterns">dyapred</dfn> weel,
Cam ridynge lyk the god of armes, Mars.
His cote-armure was of <dfn data-note="silk from Tarsia in Turkestan">clooth of Tars</dfn>
<dfn data-note="adorned">Couched</dfn> with <dfn data-note="pearls">perles</dfn> white and rounde and grete;
His sadel was of <dfn data-note="refined (pure) gold">brend gold</dfn> newe <dfn data-note="adorned">ybete</dfn>;
A <dfn data-note="short cloak">mantelet</dfn> upon his shulder hangynge,
<dfn data-note="brimful">Bret-ful</dfn> of rubyes rede as fyr sparklynge;
His <dfn data-note="curly">crispe</dfn> heer lyk rynges was <dfn data-note="fashioned (literally, run)">yronne</dfn>,
And that was yelow, and glytered as the sonne.
His nose was heigh, his eyen bright <dfn data-note="lemon-colored">citryn</dfn>,
His lippes rounde, his colour was <dfn data-note="ruddy">sangwyn</dfn>;
A fewe <dfn data-note="freckles">frakenes</dfn> in his face <dfn data-note="sprinkled">yspreynd</dfn>,
Bitwixen yelow and somdel blak <dfn data-note="mingled">ymeynd</dfn>;
And as a leon he his <dfn data-note="looked about">lookyng caste</dfn>.
Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste.
His berd was wel bigonne for to sprynge;
His voys was as a trompe thonderynge.
Upon his heed he wered of laurer grene
A gerland, fressh and lusty for to sene.
Upon his hand he bar for his <dfn data-note="delight">deduyt</dfn>
An egle tame, as any lilye whyt.
An hundred lordes hadde he with hym there,
Al armed, save hir heddes, in al hir gere,
Ful richely in alle maner thynges.
For trusteth wel that dukes, erles, kynges
Were gadered in this noble compaignye,
For love and for <dfn data-note="increase">encrees</dfn> of chivalrye.
Aboute this kyng ther ran <dfn data-note="on all sides">on every part</dfn>
Ful many a tame leon and leopart.
And in this wise thise lordes, <dfn data-note="one and all, everyone">alle and some</dfn>,
Been on the Sonday to the citee come
Aboute <dfn data-note="around 9 A.M.">pryme</dfn>, and in the toun <dfn data-note="dismounted, arrived">alight</dfn>.
This Theseus, this duc, this worthy knyght,
Whan he had broght hem into his citee,
And <dfn data-note="provided them lodging">inned hem</dfn>, everich at his degree,
He festeth hem, and <dfn data-note="makes such an effort">dooth so greet labour</dfn>
To <dfn data-note="accommodate, entertain">esen</dfn> hem and doon hem al honour
That yet men <dfn data-note="suppose">wenen</dfn> that no mannes wit
Of noon estaat ne koude amenden it.
The <dfn data-note="music">mynstralcye</dfn>, the service at the feeste,
The grete <dfn data-note="gifts to che">yiftes</dfn> to the <dfn data-note="to everyone">meeste and leeste</dfn>,
The riche <dfn data-note="adormmment">array</dfn> of Theseus paleys,
Ne who sat first ne last upon the <dfn data-note="dais">deys</dfn>,
What ladyes fairest been or best daunsynge,
Or which of hem kan dauncen best and synge,
Ne who <dfn data-note="with the most delicate understanding">moost felyngly</dfn> speketh of love;
What haukes sitten on the perche above,
What houndes <dfn data-note="lie">liggen</dfn> on the floor <dfn data-note="below">adoun</dfn> —
Of al this make I now no mencioun,
But al <dfn data-note="the substance">th’effect</dfn>; that thynketh me the beste.
Now cometh the point, and herkneth if yow leste.
The Sonday nyght, er day bigan to sprynge,
Whan Palamon the larke herde synge
(Although it nere nat day by houres two,
Yet song the larke) and Palamon right <dfn data-note="then">tho</dfn>
With hooly herte and with an heigh corage,
He roos to wenden on his pilgrymage
Unto the blisful <dfn data-note="a name for Venus, who rose from the sea at the island Cythera">Citherea</dfn> <dfn data-note="gracious">benigne</dfn> —
I mene Venus, honurable and <dfn data-note="worthy of honor">digne</dfn>.
And in hir <dfn data-note="planetary hour; see Astr 2.12.">houre</dfn> he walketh forth <dfn data-note="slowly">a pas</dfn>
Unto the lystes ther hire temple was,
And doun he kneleth, and with humble <dfn data-note="expression">cheere</dfn>
And herte soor he seyde as ye shal heere:
"Faireste of faire, O lady myn, Venus,
Doughter to Jove and spouse of Vulcanus,
Thow <dfn data-note="one who brings joy">gladere</dfn> of the mount of Citheron,
For thilke love thow haddest to <dfn data-note="Adonis">Adoon</dfn>,
Have pitee of my bittre teeris smerte,
And taak myn humble preyere at thyn herte.
Allas! I ne have no langage to telle
Th’effectes ne the <dfn data-note="tortures">tormentz</dfn> of myn helle;
Myn herte may myne harmes nat <dfn data-note="reveal">biwreye</dfn>;
I am so confus that I kan noght seye
But ‘Mercy, lady bright, that knowest weele
My thought and seest what <dfn data-note="sorrows">harmes</dfn> that I feele!’
Considere al this and <dfn data-note="have mercy">rewe</dfn> upon my <dfn data-note="pain, misery">soore</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="as surely as">As wisly as</dfn> I shal for everemoore,
<dfn data-note="according to">Emforth</dfn> my myght, thy trewe servant be,
And holden werre alwey with chastitee.
That make I myn avow, <dfn data-note="providing you help me">so ye me helpe</dfn>!
I <dfn data-note="care nothing">kepe noght</dfn> of armes for to <dfn data-note="boast">yelpe</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="to be pronounced as one syllable (n&#x27;l)">Ne I</dfn> ne axe nat tomorwe to have victorie,
Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorie
Of <dfn data-note="praise for deeds of arms proclaimed">pris of armes blowen</dfn> up and doun;
But I wolde have fully possessioun
Of Emelye, and dye in thy servyse.
Fynd thow the manere hou and in what wyse:
I <dfn data-note="care not if">recche nat but</dfn> it may bettre be
To have victorie of hem, or they of me,
So that I have my lady in myne armes.
For though so be that Mars is god of armes,
Youre <dfn data-note="power">vertu</dfn> is so greet in hevene above
That if yow list, I shal wel have my love.
Thy temple wol I worshipe everemo,
And on thyn auter, <dfn data-note="wherever I ride or walk (whatever I do)">where I ride or go</dfn>,
I wol doon sacrifice and fires <dfn data-note="kindle">beete</dfn>.
And if ye wol nat so, my lady sweete,
Thanne preye I thee, tomorwe with a spere
That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.
Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,
Though that Arcita wynne hire to his wyf.
This is th’effect and ende of my preyere:
<dfn data-note="give">Yif</dfn> me my love, thow blisful lady deere."
Whan the orison was doon of Palamon,
His sacrifice he dide, and that anon,
Ful pitously, with alle <dfn data-note="ceremony, due propriety">circumstaunces</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="although.">Al</dfn> telle I noght as now his observaunces;
But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,
And made a signe, wherby that he took
That his preyere accepted was that day.
For thogh the signe shewed a delay,
Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his <dfn data-note="request">boone</dfn>,
And with glad herte he wente hym hoom ful soone.
The thridde <dfn data-note="planetary hour; see Astr 2.10.">houre inequal</dfn> that Palamon
Bigan to Venus temple for to gon,
Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye
And to the temple of Dyane <dfn data-note="hurried">gan hye</dfn>.
Hir maydens, that she thider with hire ladde,
Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde,
Th’encens, the clothes, and the remenant al
That to the sacrifice <dfn data-note="belong">longen</dfn> shal;
The hornes fulle of <dfn data-note="mead">meeth</dfn>, as was the gyse —
Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifise.
<dfn data-note="censing">Smokynge</dfn> the temple, ful of clothes faire,
This Emelye, with herte <dfn data-note="genic">debonaire</dfn>,
Hir body <dfn data-note="washed">wessh</dfn> with water of a welle.
But hou she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,
But it be any thing in general;
And yet it were a game to heeren al.
To hym that meneth wel it were no <dfn data-note="burden">charge</dfn>;
But it is good a man been <dfn data-note="without restriction">at his large</dfn>.
Hir brighte heer was <dfn data-note="combed">kembd</dfn>, <dfn data-note="loose">untressed</dfn> al;
A coroune of a grene <dfn data-note="an evergrecn oak of southern Europe (Quercus Cerris)">ook cerial</dfn>
Upon hir heed was set ful fair and <dfn data-note="suitable, fitting">meete</dfn>.
Two fyres on the auter gan she <dfn data-note="kindle, feed">beete</dfn>,
And dide hir <dfn data-note="business, dutics">thynges</dfn>, as men may biholde
In <dfn data-note="Statius’s Thebuid (quoted as an epigraph to this tale)">Stace of Thebes</dfn> and thise bookes olde.
Whan kyndled was the fyr, with pitous cheere
Unto Dyane she spak as ye may heere:
"O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is <dfn data-note="visible">sene</dfn>,
Queene of the regne of <dfn data-note="god of the underworld">Pluto</dfn> derk and lowe,
Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe
Ful many a yeer, and woost what I desire,
<dfn data-note="keep (as is not translated)">As keepe</dfn> me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,
That Attheon <dfn data-note="Actacon paid for">aboughte</dfn> cruelly.
Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I
Desire to ben a mayden al my lyf,
Ne nevere wol I be no love ne wyf.
I am, thow woost, yet of thy compaignye,
A mayde, and love huntynge and <dfn data-note="hunting">venerye</dfn>,
And for to walken in the wodes wilde, 
And noght to ben a wyf and be with childe.
Noght wol I knowe <dfn data-note="sexual intercourse">compaignye of man</dfn>.
Now help me, lady, sith ye may and kan,
For <dfn data-note="those three forms (as goddess of the chase, the moon, the underworld — cf. 2297-99 above)">tho thre formes</dfn> that thou hast in thee.
And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
And eek Arcite, that loveth me so soore,
This grace I preye thee withoute moore,
As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two,
And fro me turne awey hir hertes so
That al hire hoote love and hir desir,
And al hir <dfn data-note="intense">bisy</dfn> torment, and hir fir
Be <dfn data-note="extinguished">queynt</dfn>, or turned in another place.
And if so be thou wolt nat do me grace,
Or if my destynee be shapen so
That I shal <dfn data-note="of necessity">nedes</dfn> have oon of hem two,
As sende me hym that moost desireth me.
Bihoold, goddesse of clene chastitee,
The bittre teeris that on my chekes falle.
Syn thou art mayde and kepere of us alle,
My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,
And whil I lyve, a mayde I wol thee serve."
The fires brenne upon the auter cleere,
Whil Emelye was thus in hir preyere.
But sodeynly she saugh a sighte <dfn data-note="curious">queynte</dfn>,
For right anon oon of the fyres <dfn data-note="went out, was extinguished">queynte</dfn>
"And <dfn data-note="rekindled">quyked</dfn> agayn, and after that anon 
That oother fyr was <dfn data-note="extinguished">queynt</dfn> and al agon;
And as it queynte it made a <dfn data-note="roaring sound">whistelynge</dfn>,
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brennynge,
And at the brondes ende out ran anon
As it were blody dropes many oon;
For which so soore <dfn data-note="frightened">agast</dfn> was Emelye
That she was wel ny mad and gan to crye,
For she ne wiste what it signyfied,
But oonly for the feere thus hath she cried,
And <dfn data-note="wept">weep</dfn> that it was pitee for to heere.
And therwithal Dyane gan appeere,
With bowe in honde, right as an hunteresse,
And seyde, "Doghter, <dfn data-note="cease">stynt</dfn> thyn hevynesse.
Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
And by eterne word writen and confermed,
Thou shalt ben wedded unto oon of <dfn data-note="those">tho</dfn>
That han for thee so muchel care and wo,
But unto which of hem I may nat telle.
Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
The fires which that on myn auter brenne
Shulle thee declaren, er that thou go <dfn data-note="hence, away">henne</dfn>,
Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas."
And with that word, the arwes in the caas
Of the goddesse clateren faste and rynge,
And forth she wente and made a vanysshynge;
For which this Emelye <dfn data-note="astonished">astoned</dfn> was,
And seyde, "What amounteth this, allas?
I putte me in thy proteccioun, 
Dyane, and in thy disposicioun."
And hoom she goth anon the <dfn data-note="nearest">nexte</dfn> weye.
This is th’effect; ther is namoore to seye.
The nexte <dfn data-note="planetary hour">houre</dfn> of Mars folwynge this,
Arcite unto the temple walked is
Of fierse Mars to doon his sacrifise,
With alle the rytes of his <dfn data-note="pagan manner (of worship)">payen wyse</dfn>.
With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,
Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:
"O stronge god, that in the regnes colde
Of Trace honoured art and lord yholde,
And hast in every regne and every lond
Of armes al the brydel in thyn hond,
And <dfn data-note="grant them fortune, control their destinies">hem fortunest</dfn> as thee lyst devyse,
Accepte of me my pitous sacrifise.
If so be that my youthe may deserve,
And that my myght be worthy for to serve
Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thyne,
Thanne preye I thee to rewe upon my <dfn data-note="pain">pyne</dfn>.
For thilke peyne and thilke hoote fir
In which thow whilom brendest for desir,
Whan that thow usedest the beautee
Of faire, yonge, fresshe Venus free,
And haddest hire in armes at thy wille —
Although thee ones on a tyme <dfn data-note="things went wrong (for) you">mysfille</dfn>,
Whan <dfn data-note="Vulcan">Vulcanus</dfn> hadde caught thee in his las
And foond thee <dfn data-note="lying">liggynge</dfn> by his wyf, allas! —
For thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte,
Have routhe as wel upon my peynes smerte.
I am yong and <dfn data-note="ignorant, unskillful">unkonnynge</dfn>, as thow woost,
And, as I trowe, <dfn data-note="by">with</dfn> love offended moost
That evere was any <dfn data-note="living">lyves</dfn> creature,
For she that <dfn data-note="makes">dooth</dfn> me al this wo endure
Ne reccheth nevere <dfn data-note="whether I sink or float">wher I synke or fleete</dfn>.
And wel I woot, er she me mercy <dfn data-note="promise">heete</dfn>,
I moot with strengthe wynne hire in the <dfn data-note="area where the action takes place, i.e., lists">place</dfn>,
And wel I woot, withouten help or grace
Of thee ne may my strengthe noght availle.
Thanne help me, lord, tomorwe in my bataille,
For thilke fyr that whilom brente thee,
As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me,
And <dfn data-note="cause, bring about">do</dfn> that I tomorwe have victorie.
Myn be the <dfn data-note="labor">travaille</dfn>, and thyn be the glorie!
Thy <dfn data-note="best, most excellent">sovereyn</dfn> temple wol I moost honouren
Of any place, and alwey moost labouren
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,
And in thy temple I wol my baner honge
And alle the armes of my compaignye,
And everemo, unto that day I dye,
Eterne fir I wol bifore thee <dfn data-note="provide">fynde</dfn>.
And eek to this avow I wol me bynde:
My beerd, myn heer, that hongeth long adoun,
That nevere yet ne felte <dfn data-note="injury">offensioun</dfn>
Of rasour nor of <dfn data-note="scissors">shere</dfn>, I wol thee yive,
And ben thy trewe servant whil I lyve.
Now, lord, have routhe upon my sorwes soore;
Yif me [victorie]; I aske thee namoore."
The preyere <dfn data-note="stinted, stopped">stynt</dfn> of Arcita the stronge,
The rynges on the temple dore that honge,
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,
Of which Arcita somwhat <dfn data-note="was afraid">hym agaste</dfn>.
The fyres brenden upon the auter brighte
That it gan al the temple for to lighte;
A sweete smel the ground anon up yaf,
And Arcita anon his hand up <dfn data-note="raised">haf</dfn>,
And moore encens into the fyr he caste,
With othere rytes mo; and atte laste
The statue of Mars bigan his <dfn data-note="coat of mail">hauberk</dfn> rynge,
And with that <dfn data-note="sound">soun</dfn> he herde a murmurynge
Ful lowe and dym, and seyde thus, "Victorie!"
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.
And thus with joye and hope wel to fare
Arcite anon unto his <dfn data-note="inn, lodgings">in</dfn> is fare,
As <dfn data-note="glad">fayn</dfn> as fowel is of the brighte sonne.
And right anon swich strif ther is bigonne,
For thilke grauntyng, in the hevene above,
Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,
And Mars, the <dfn data-note="stern, cruel">stierne</dfn> god <dfn data-note="powerful in arms">armypotente</dfn>,

Foond in his olde experience an <dfn data-note="plan">art</dfn>

As sooth is seyd, <dfn data-note="old age">elde</dfn> hath greet avantage;
In elde is bothe wysdom and <dfn data-note="experience">usage</dfn>;
Men may the olde atrenne and noght atrede.
Saturne anon, to stynten strif and drede,
Al be it that it is agayn his <dfn data-note="nature">kynde</dfn>,
Of al this strif he gan remedie fynde.
"My deere doghter Venus," <dfn data-note="said">quod</dfn> Saturne,

Greet was the feeste in Atthenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to been in swich <dfn data-note="delight">plesaunce</dfn>
That al that Monday <dfn data-note="joust">justen</dfn> they and daunce,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
But by the cause that they sholde ryse
Eerly, for to seen the grete fight,
Unto hir reste wenten they at nyght.
And on the morwe, whan that day gan sprynge,
Of hors and harneys noyse and claterynge
Ther was in hostelryes al aboute,
And to the paleys rood ther many a route
Of lordes upon steedes and palfreys.
Ther maystow seen <dfn data-note="preparation of armor">devisynge of harneys</dfn>
So <dfn data-note="exotic">unkouth</dfn> and so riche, and wroght so weel
Of goldsmythrye, of <dfn data-note="embroidery">browdynge</dfn>, and of steel;

There as nede is they weren no thyng ydel;
The fomy steedes on the golden brydel 
Gnawynge, and faste the armurers also
With fyle and hamer prikynge to and fro;
Yemen on foote, and <dfn data-note="common soldiers">communes</dfn> many oon
With shorte staves, thikke as they may <dfn data-note="walk">goon</dfn>;
Pypes, trompes, <dfn data-note="kettle drums">nakers</dfn>, <dfn data-note="bugles">clariounes</dfn>,

The paleys ful of peple up and doun,
Heere thre, ther ten, <dfn data-note="debating">holdynge hir questioun</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="conjecturing about">Dyvynynge of</dfn> thise Thebane knyghtes two.
Somme seyden thus, somme seyde "it shal be so";
Somme helden with hym with the blake berd,
Somme with the <dfn data-note="bald">balled</dfn>, somme with the <dfn data-note="thickly haired (man)">thikke herd</dfn>;
Somme seyde <dfn data-note="that fellow">he</dfn> looked grymme, and he wolde fighte:
"He hath a <dfn data-note="battle-axe">sparth</dfn> of twenty pound of <dfn data-note="weight">wighte</dfn>."
Thus was the halle ful of <dfn data-note="speculation">divynynge</dfn>,
Longe after that the sonne gan to sprynge.
The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
With mynstralcie and noyse that was maked,
Heeld yet the chambre of his paleys riche
Til that the Thebane knyghtes, bothe <dfn data-note="alike">yliche</dfn>
Honured, were into the paleys <dfn data-note="fetched, brought">fet</dfn>.
Duc Theseus was at a wyndow set,
Arrayed right as he were a god in <dfn data-note="throne">trone</dfn>.
The peple <dfn data-note="push">preesseth</dfn> <dfn data-note="thither, toward there">thiderward</dfn> ful soone
Hym for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,
And eek to herkne his <dfn data-note="command">heste</dfn> and his <dfn data-note="decision">sentence</dfn>.
An heraud on a scaffold made an "Oo!"
Til al the noyse of peple was ydo,
And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,
Tho shewed he the myghty dukes wille:
"The lord hath of his heigh <dfn data-note="sound judgment">discrecioun</dfn>
Considered that it were destruccioun
To gentil blood to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille now in this <dfn data-note="undertaking">emprise</dfn>.
Wherfore, to shapen that they shal nat dye,
He wol his <dfn data-note="previous">firste</dfn> purpos modifye.
No man therfore, <dfn data-note="on">up</dfn> peyne of los of lyf,
No maner <dfn data-note="arrow">shot</dfn>, ne <dfn data-note="batde axe">polax</dfn>, ne short knyf
Into the lystes sende or thider brynge;
Ne short swerd, for to <dfn data-note="stab, jab">stoke</dfn> with poynt bitynge,
No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde.
Ne no man shal unto his felawe ryde

<dfn data-note="let him thrust">Foyne</dfn>, if hym list, on foote, hymself to <dfn data-note="protect">were</dfn>.
And he that is <dfn data-note="in distress, at a disadvantage">at meschief</dfn> shal be take
And noght slayn, but be broght unto the stake
That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;
But thider he shal by force, and there <dfn data-note="remain">abyde</dfn>.
And if so falle the chieftayn be take
On outher syde, or elles sleen his <dfn data-note="opponent">make</dfn>,
No lenger shal the <dfn data-note="tournament">turneiynge</dfn> laste.
God <dfn data-note="give you success">spede you</dfn>! Gooth forth and ley on faste!
With long swerd and with mace fighteth youre fille.
Gooth now youre wey; this is the lordes wille."
The voys of peple touchede the hevene,
So loude cride they with murie <dfn data-note="voice">stevene</dfn>,
"God save swich a lord, that is so good
He wilneth no destruccion of blood!"
Up goon the trompes and the melodye,
And to the lystes rit the compaignye,
By ordinance, thurghout the citee large,
Hanged with clooth of gold, and nat with <dfn data-note="serge">sarge</dfn>.
Ful lik a lord this noble duc gan ryde,
Thise two Thebans upon either syde,
And after rood the queene and Emelye,
And after that another compaignye
Of oon and oother, <dfn data-note="according to their rank">after hir degree</dfn>.
And thus they passen thurghout the citee,
And to the lystes come they by tyme.
It nas nat of the day yet fully <dfn data-note="9 A.M.">pryme</dfn>
Whan set was Theseus ful <dfn data-note="splendidly">riche</dfn> and hye,
Ypolita the queene, and Emelye,
And othere ladys in <dfn data-note="tiers, rows of seats">degrees</dfn> aboute.
Unto the seetes preesseth al the route.
And westward, thurgh the gates under Marte,
Arcite, and eek the hondred of his <dfn data-note="party, side">parte</dfn>,
With baner reed is entred right anon;
And in that <dfn data-note="same">selve</dfn> moment Palamon
Is under Venus, estward in the place,
With baner whyt and hardy chiere and face.
In al the world, to seken up and doun,
So evene, withouten variacioun,
Ther nere swiche compaignyes tweye,
For ther was noon so wys that koude seye
That any hadde of oother avauntage
Of worthynesse, ne of estaat, ne age,
So <dfn data-note="equally">evene</dfn> were they chosen, <dfn data-note="as an estimate">for to gesse</dfn>.
And in two <dfn data-note="ranks">renges</dfn> faire they <dfn data-note="arrange themselves">hem dresse</dfn>.
Whan that hir names <dfn data-note="read">rad</dfn> were everichon,
That in hir nombre <dfn data-note="deception">gyle</dfn> were ther noon,
Tho were the gates <dfn data-note="shut">shet</dfn>, and cried was loude:
"Do now youre <dfn data-note="duty">devoir</dfn>, yonge knyghtes proude!"
The heraudes lefte hir prikyng up and doun;
Now ryngen trompes loude and clarioun.
Ther is namoore to seyn, but west and est
In goon the speres ful <dfn data-note="firmly">sadly</dfn> in <dfn data-note="lance rest (on the breast plate)">arrest</dfn>;
In gooth the sharpe <dfn data-note="spur into the flank">spore into the syde</dfn>.
Ther seen men who kan juste and who kan ryde;
Ther <dfn data-note="shiver, break">shyveren</dfn> shaftes upon sheeldes thikke;
He feeleth thurgh the <dfn data-note="the spoon-shaped hollow at the end of the breastbone">herte-spoon</dfn> the prikke.
Up spryngen speres twenty foot on highte;
Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte;
The helmes they <dfn data-note="hew to pieces and cut into shreds">tohewen and toshrede</dfn>;
Out <dfn data-note="burst">brest</dfn> the blood with <dfn data-note="strong">stierne</dfn> stremes rede;
With myghty maces the bones they <dfn data-note="break to pieces">tobreste</dfn>.
He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste;
Ther stomblen steedes stronge, and doun gooth al,
He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal;
He <dfn data-note="stabs">foyneth</dfn> on his feet with his <dfn data-note="spear shaft">tronchoun</dfn>,
And he hym <dfn data-note="knocks down">hurtleth with his hors adoun;</dfn>
He thurgh the body is hurt and sithen take,
<dfn data-note="despite all he can do">Maugree his heed</dfn>, and broght unto the stake;
As forward was, right there he moste <dfn data-note="remain">abyde</dfn>.
Another lad is on that oother syde.
And some tyme <dfn data-note="Theseus makes them rest">dooth hem Theseus to reste</dfn>,
Hem to refresshe and drynken, if hem leste.
Ful ofte a day han thise Thebanes two
Togydre ymet, and wroght his felawe wo;
Unhorsed hath ech oother of hem tweye.
Ther nas no tygre in the vale of <dfn data-note="probably Gargaphia, a valley in Boetia (Greece)">Galgopheye</dfn>,
Whan that hir <dfn data-note="cub">whelp</dfn> is stole whan it is lite,
So crueel on the hunte as is Arcite
For jelous herte upon this Palamon.
Ne in <dfn data-note="Benmarin (Morocco)">Belmarye</dfn> ther nys so fel leon,
That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,
Ne of his <dfn data-note="prey">praye</dfn> desireth so the blood,
As Palamon to sleen his foo Arcite.
The <dfn data-note="fervent, vigorous">jelous</dfn> strokes on hir helmes byte;
Out <dfn data-note="runs">renneth</dfn> blood on bothe hir sydes rede.
Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede.
For er the sonne unto the reste wente,
The stronge kyng Emetreus gan hente
This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
And made his swerd depe in his flessh to byte,
And by the force of twenty is he take
<dfn data-note="without having surrendered">Unyolden</dfn>, and ydrawen to the stake.
And in the <dfn data-note="rescue">rescus</dfn> of this Palamoun
The stronge kyng Lygurge is born adoun,
And kyng Emetreus, for al his strengthe,
Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
So hitte him Palamoun er he were take.
But al for noght; he was broght to the stake.
His hardy herte myghte hym helpe naught:
He moste abyde, whan that he was caught,
By force and eek by <dfn data-note="agreement (that he had made)">composicioun</dfn>.
Who <dfn data-note="grieves">sorweth</dfn> now but woful Palamoun,
That moot namoore goon agayn to fighte?
And whan that Theseus hadde seyn this sighte,
Unto the folk that foghten thus <dfn data-note="each one">echon</dfn>
He cryde, "<dfn data-note="stop!">Hoo!</dfn> namoore, for it is doon!
I wol be trewe juge, and no <dfn data-note="partisan">partie</dfn>.
Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelie,
That by his fortune hath hire faire ywonne."
Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne
For joye of this, so loude and heighe withalle
It semed that the lystes sholde falle.
What kan now faire Venus doon above?
What seith she now? What dooth this queene of love,
But wepeth so, for <dfn data-note="lack">wantynge</dfn> of hir wille,
Til that hir <dfn data-note="i.e., it rained">teeres in the lystes fille</dfn>?
She seyde, "I am <dfn data-note="disgraced">ashamed</dfn>, doutelees."
Saturnus seyde, "Doghter, hoold thy pees!
Mars hath his wille, his knyght hath al his <dfn data-note="request">boone</dfn>,
And, by myn heed, thow shalt been <dfn data-note="relieved">esed</dfn> soone."
The <dfn data-note="trumpeters">trompours</dfn>, with the loude mynstralcie,
The heraudes, that ful loude yelle and crie,
Been in hire <dfn data-note="prosperity">wele</dfn> for joye of daun Arcite.
But herkneth me, and stynteth noyse a lite,
<dfn data-note="what a">Which a</dfn> myracle ther bifel anon.
This fierse Arcite hath <dfn data-note="taken off his helmet">of his helm ydon</dfn>,
And on a courser, for to <dfn data-note="show">shewe</dfn> his face,
He priketh <dfn data-note="from end to end">endelong</dfn> the large place
Lokynge upward upon this Emelye; 
And she <dfn data-note="toward">agayn</dfn> hym caste a freendlich ye
(For wommen, as to speken <dfn data-note="in general">in comune</dfn>,
Thei folwen alle the favour of Fortune)
And was al his <dfn data-note="source of pleasure">chiere</dfn>, as in his herte.
Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
From Pluto sent at requeste of Saturne,
For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
And <dfn data-note="leapt">leep</dfn> aside, and <dfn data-note="stumbled">foundred</dfn> as he leep;
And er that Arcite may <dfn data-note="take heed">taken keep</dfn>,
He <dfn data-note="struck himself">pighte hym</dfn> on the <dfn data-note="pommel (knob on a saddle)">pomel</dfn> of his heed,
That in the place he lay as he were deed,
His brest <dfn data-note="shattered">tobrosten</dfn> with his sadel-bowe.
As blak he lay as any <dfn data-note="coal">cole</dfn> or crowe,
So was the blood yronnen in his face.
Anon he was yborn out of the place,
With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.
<dfn data-note="then">Tho</dfn> was he <dfn data-note="cut">korven</dfn> out of his harneys
And in a bed ybrought ful faire and <dfn data-note="quickly">blyve</dfn>,
For he was yet <dfn data-note="conscious">in memorie</dfn> and alyve,
And alwey criynge <dfn data-note="for">after</dfn> Emelye.
Duc Theseus, with al his compaignye,
Is comen hoom to Atthenes his citee,
With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
Al be it that this aventure was falle,
He nolde noght <dfn data-note="distress">disconforten</dfn> hem alle.
Men seyde eek that Arcite shal nat dye; 
He shal been heeled of his maladye.
And of another thyng they weren as <dfn data-note="happy">fayn</dfn>,
That of hem alle was ther noon yslayn,
Al were they soore yhurt, and <dfn data-note="especially">namely</dfn> oon,
That with a spere was thirled his brest boon.
To othere woundes and to broken armes
Somme hadden salves, and somme hadden charmes;
<dfn data-note="medicines">Fermacies</dfn> of herbes, and eek <dfn data-note="sage, in a concoction">save</dfn>
They dronken, for they wolde hir lymes have.
For which this noble duc, as he wel kan,
Conforteth and honoureth every man,
And made revel al the longe nyght
Unto the <dfn data-note="foreign">straunge</dfn> lordes, as was right.
Ne ther was holden no <dfn data-note="defeat, dishonor">disconfitynge</dfn>
But as a <dfn data-note="joust or a tournament">justes or a tourneiynge</dfn>;
For soothly ther was no <dfn data-note="dishonor">disconfiture</dfn>.
For fallyng nys nat but an aventure,
Ne to be lad by force unto the stake
<dfn data-note="without having surrendered">Unyolden</dfn>, and with twenty knyghtes take,
O persone allone, withouten <dfn data-note="others">mo</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="dragged">haryed</dfn> forth by arme, foot, and <dfn data-note="toe">too</dfn>,
And eke his steede dryven forth with staves
With footmen, bothe yemen and eek <dfn data-note="male servants">knaves</dfn> —
It nas arretted hym no vileynye;
Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.
For which anon duc Theseus <dfn data-note="had proclaimed">leet crye</dfn>,
To stynten alle rancour and <dfn data-note="ill-will">envye</dfn>,
The <dfn data-note="victory">gree</dfn> as wel of o syde as of oother,
And eyther syde ylik as ootheres brother;
And yaf hem <dfn data-note="gifts">yiftes</dfn> after hir degree,
And fully heeld a feeste dayes three,
And conveyed the kynges worthily
Out of his toun a <dfn data-note="day&#x27;s journey">journee</dfn> largely.
And hoom wente every man the righte way.
Ther was namoore but "Fare wel, have good day!"
Of this bataille I wol namoore <dfn data-note="write">endite</dfn>,
But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the soore
Encreesseth at his herte moore and moore.

<dfn data-note="this is">This</dfn> al and som, that Arcita moot dye;

And if that evere ye shul ben a wyf,
Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man."
And with that word his speche <dfn data-note="began to fail">faille gan</dfn>,
For from his feet up to his brest was come
The coold of deeth, that hadde hym overcome,
And yet mooreover, for in his armes two
The vital strengthe is lost and al ago.
Oonly the intellect, withouten moore,
That dwelled in his herte syk and soore,
Gan faillen whan the herte felte deeth.
<dfn data-note="grew dark">Dusked</dfn> his eyen two, and failled breeth,
But on his lady yet caste he his ye;
His laste word was, "Mercy, Emelye!"
His spirit chaunged hous and wente ther,
As I cam nevere, I kan nat tellen wher.
Therfore I stynte; I <dfn data-note="ne am, am not">nam</dfn> no <dfn data-note="theologian">divinistre</dfn>;
Of soules fynde I nat in this registre,
Ne me ne list thilke opinions to telle
Of hem, though that they writen wher they dwelle.
Arcite is coold, <dfn data-note="may Mars guide his soul">ther Mars his soule gye</dfn>!
Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.
<dfn data-note="shrieked">Shrighte</dfn> Emelye, and howleth Palamon,
And Theseus his suster took anon
Swownynge, and baar hire fro the corps away.
What helpeth it to tarien forth the day
To tellen how she <dfn data-note="wept">weep</dfn> bothe eve and morwe?
For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,
Whan that hir housbondes ben from hem ago,
That <dfn data-note="mostly">for the moore part</dfn> they sorwen so,
Or ellis fallen in swich maladye
That at the laste certeinly they dye.
Infinite been the sorwes and the teeres
Of olde folk and folk of tendre yeeres
In al the toun for deeth of this Theban.
For hym ther wepeth bothe child and man;
So greet wepyng was ther noon, certayn,
Whan Ector was ybroght, al fressh yslayn,
To Troye. Allas, the pitee that was ther,
<dfn data-note="scratching">Cracchynge</dfn> of chekes, rentynge eek of heer.
"Why woldestow be deed," thise wommen crye,
"And haddest gold ynough, and Emelye?"
No man myghte <dfn data-note="comfort">gladen</dfn> Theseus,
<dfn data-note="except for">Savynge</dfn> his olde fader Egeus,
That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
As he hadde seyn it chaunge bothe up and doun,
Joye after wo, and wo after gladnesse,
And shewed hem ensamples and liknesse.
"Right as ther dyed nevere man," quod he,
"That he ne lyvede in erthe in some degree,
Right so ther lyvede never man," he seyde,
"In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.
This world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo,
And we been pilgrymes, passynge to and fro.
Deeth is an ende of every worldly <dfn data-note="pain, misery">soore</dfn>."
And over al this yet seyde he muchel moore
To this effect, ful wisely to <dfn data-note="encourage">enhorte</dfn>
The peple that they sholde <dfn data-note="take heart">hem reconforte</dfn>.
Duc Theseus, with al his <dfn data-note="careful attention">bisy cure</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="considered">Caste</dfn> now wher that the sepulture
Of goode Arcite may best ymaked be,
And eek moost honurable in his degree.
And at the laste he took conclusioun
That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun
Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
That in that <dfn data-note="same">selve</dfn> grove, <dfn data-note="sweet-smelling">swoote</dfn> and grene,
Ther as he hadde his amorouse desires,
His <dfn data-note="lament">compleynte</dfn>, and for love his hoote fires,
He wolde make a fyr in which the office
Funeral he myghte al accomplice.
And <dfn data-note="ordered">leet comande</dfn> anon to hakke and hewe
The okes olde, and leye hem <dfn data-note="In a row">On a rewe</dfn>
In <dfn data-note="piles">colpons</dfn> wel <dfn data-note="arranged">arrayed</dfn> for to brenne.
His officers with swifte feet they renne
And ryde anon at his comandement.
And after this, Theseus hath ysent
After a <dfn data-note="funeral bier">beere</dfn>, and it al <dfn data-note="overspread">overspradde</dfn>
With clooth of gold, the richeste that he hadde.
And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;
Upon his hondes hadde he gloves white,
Eek on his heed a coroune of laurer grene,
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
He leyde hym, bare the visage, on the beere;
Therwith he weep that pitee was to heere.
And for the peple sholde seen hym alle,
Whan it was day, he broghte hym to the halle,
That roreth of the criyng and the soun.
Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,
With <dfn data-note="waving">flotery</dfn> berd and <dfn data-note="rough">ruggy</dfn>, asshy heeres,
In clothes blake, ydropped al with teeres;
And, passynge othere of wepynge, Emelye,
The <dfn data-note="most pitiful">rewefulleste</dfn> of al the compaignye.
In as muche as the servyce sholde be
The moore noble and riche in his degree,
Duc Theseus leet forth thre steedes <dfn data-note="had brought forth">brynge</dfn>,
That <dfn data-note="equipped with trappings">trapped</dfn> were in steel al gliterynge,
And covered with the <dfn data-note="heraldic devices">armes</dfn> of daun Arcite.
Upon thise steedes, that weren grete and white,
Ther seten folk, of whiche oon baar his sheeld,
Another his spere up on his hondes heeld,
The thridde baar with hym his <dfn data-note="Turkish bow">bowe Turkeys</dfn>
(Of <dfn data-note="refined (pure) gold">brend gold</dfn> was the caas and eek the harneys);
And riden forth <dfn data-note="slowly">a paas</dfn> with sorweful cheere
Toward the grove, as ye shul after heere.
The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were
Upon hir shuldres caryeden the <dfn data-note="funeral bier">beere</dfn>,
With <dfn data-note="slow">slakke</dfn> paas and eyen rede and wete,
Thurghout the citee by the <dfn data-note="main street">maister strete</dfn>,
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
Right of the same is the strete ywrye.
Upon the right hond wente olde Egeus,
And on that oother syde duc Theseus,
With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,
Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;
Eek Palamon, with ful greet compaignye;
And after that cam woful Emelye,
With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,
To do the office of funeral servyse.
Heigh labour and ful greet <dfn data-note="preparation">apparaillynge</dfn>
Was at the service and the fyr-makynge,
That with his grene top the hevene <dfn data-note="reached to">raughte</dfn>;
And twenty <dfn data-note="fathoms broad">fadme of brede</dfn> the <dfn data-note="sides projected">armes straughte</dfn> —
This is to seyn, the bowes weren so brode.
Of <dfn data-note="straw">stree</dfn> first ther was leyd ful many a <dfn data-note="load">lode</dfn>.
But how the fyr was maked upon highte,
Ne eek the names that the trees highte, 
As ook, firre, birch, aspe, alder, <dfn data-note="probably the holm oak">holm</dfn>, popler,
<dfn data-note="willow">Wylugh</dfn>, elm, plane, assh, box, <dfn data-note="chestnut tree">chasteyn</dfn>, lynde, <dfn data-note="laurel">laurer</dfn>,

How they weren feld shal nat be toold for me;
Ne hou the goddes <dfn data-note="ran">ronnen</dfn> up and doun,
Disherited of hire habitacioun,
In which they <dfn data-note="dwelt">woneden</dfn> in reste and pees,
Nymphes, <dfn data-note="fauns">fawnes</dfn> and <dfn data-note="Hamadryads (wood nymphs)">amadrides</dfn>;
Ne hou the beestes and the briddes alle
Fledden for fere, whan the wode was falle;
Ne how the ground <dfn data-note="was frightened by">agast was of</dfn> the light,
That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;
Ne how the fyr was <dfn data-note="laid">couched</dfn> first with <dfn data-note="straw">stree</dfn>,
And thanne with drye <dfn data-note="tree trunks">stikkes</dfn> cloven a thre,
And thanne with grene wode and <dfn data-note="mixture of spices">spicerye</dfn>,
And thanne with clooth of gold and with <dfn data-note="precious stones">perrye</dfn>,
And gerlandes, hangynge with ful many a flour;
The <dfn data-note="myrrh">mirre</dfn>, th’encens, with al so greet odour;
Ne how Arcite lay among al this,
Ne what richesse aboute his body is;
Ne how that Emelye, as was the gyse,
Putte in the fyr of funeral servyse;
Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr,
Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desir;
Ne what jeweles men in the fyre caste,
Whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste;
Ne how somme caste hir sheeld, and somme hir spere,
And of hire <dfn data-note="costumes, garbs">vestimentz</dfn>, whiche that they were,
And coppes fulle of wyn, and milk, and blood,
Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood;
Ne how the Grekes, with an huge route,
Thries riden al the fyr aboute
Upon the left hand, with a loud shoutynge,
And thries with hir speres claterynge;
And thries how the ladyes gonne crye;
And how that lad was homward Emelye;
Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;
Ne how that <dfn data-note="wake">lyche-wake</dfn> was yholde
Al thilke nyght; ne how the Grekes pleye
The <dfn data-note="funeral games">wake-pleyes</dfn>; ne kepe I nat to seye
Who wrastleth best naked with oille enoynt,
Ne who that baar hym best, in no <dfn data-note="difficulty">disjoynt</dfn>.
I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
Hoom til Atthenes, whan the pley is doon;
But shortly to the point thanne wol I wende
And maken of my longe tale an ende.
By <dfn data-note="course of events">processe</dfn> and by lengthe of certeyn yeres,
Al stynted is the moornynge and the teres
Of Grekes, by oon general assent.
Thanne semed me ther was a <dfn data-note="parliament">parlement</dfn>
At Atthenes, upon certein pointz and caas;
Among the whiche pointz yspoken was,
To have with certein contrees alliaunce,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
For which this noble Theseus anon
Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
<dfn data-note="unknown by">Unwist of</dfn> hym what was the cause and why,
But in his blake clothes sorwefully
He cam at his comandement <dfn data-note="in haste">in hye</dfn>.
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.
Whan they were set, and <dfn data-note="quiet">hust</dfn> was al the place,
And Theseus <dfn data-note="waited">abiden</dfn> hadde a space
Er any word cam fram his wise brest,
His eyen sette he ther as was his <dfn data-note="pleasure">lest</dfn>.
And with a sad visage he siked stille,
And after that right thus he <dfn data-note="pronounced his decision">seyde his wille</dfn>:
"The Firste Moevere of the cause above,
Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,
Greet was th’effect, and heigh was his <dfn data-note="plan">entente</dfn>.
Wel wiste he why, and what thereof he mente,
For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond
In <dfn data-note="definite, specific">certeyn</dfn> boundes, that they may nat flee.
That same Prince and that Moevere," quod he,
"Hath stablissed in this wrecched world <dfn data-note="below">adoun</dfn>
Certeyne dayes and duracioun
To al that is engendred in this place,
Over the whiche day they may nat pace,
Al <dfn data-note="can">mowe</dfn> they yet tho dayes wel <dfn data-note="abridge, shorten">abregge</dfn>.
Ther nedeth noght <dfn data-note="to cite no written authorities">noon auctoritee t’allegge</dfn>,
For it is <dfn data-note="proven">preeved</dfn> by experience,
But that me list declaren my sentence.
Thanne may men by this ordre wel discerne
That thilke Moevere stable is and eterne.
Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,
That every part dirryveth from <dfn data-note="its">his</dfn> hool,
For nature hath nat taken his bigynnyng
Of no <dfn data-note="part">partie</dfn> or <dfn data-note="portion">cantel</dfn> of a thyng,
But of a thyng that parfit is and stable,
Descendynge so til it be <dfn data-note="corruptible">corrumpable</dfn>.
And therfore, <dfn data-note="by his wise foresight">of his wise purveiaunce</dfn>,
He hath so wel <dfn data-note="established">biset</dfn> his ordinaunce
That <dfn data-note="species (types of being)">speces</dfn> of thynges and <dfn data-note="natural processes">progressiouns</dfn>
Shullen enduren <dfn data-note="one after another">by successiouns</dfn>,
And nat eterne, withouten any lye.
This maystow understonde and seen <dfn data-note="plainly">at ye</dfn>.
"Loo the ook, that hath so long a norisshynge
From tyme that it first bigynneth to sprynge,
And hath so long a lif, as we may see,
Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.
"Considereth eek how that the harde stoon
Under oure feet, on which we trede and goon,
Yet wasteth it as it lyth by the weye.
The brode ryver somtyme <dfn data-note="becomes">wexeth</dfn> dreye;
The grete tounes se we wane and wende.
Thanne may ye se that al this thyng hath ende.
"Of man and womman seen we wel also
That nedes, in oon of thise <dfn data-note="periods of time">termes</dfn> two —
This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age —
He moot be deed, the kyng as shal a <dfn data-note="servant boy">page</dfn>;
Som in his bed, sorn in the depe see,
Som in the large feeld, as men may see;
Ther helpeth noght; al goth that <dfn data-note="same">ilke</dfn> weye.
Thanne may I seyn that al this thyng moot deye.
"What maketh this but Juppiter, the kyng,
That is prince and cause of alle thyng,
Convertynge al unto his propre welle
From which it is dirryved, sooth to telle?
And <dfn data-note="against this">heer-agayns</dfn> no creature on lyve,
Of no degree, availleth for to stryve.
"Thanne is it wysdom, as it thynketh me,
To maken vertu of necessitee,
And take it weel that we may nat <dfn data-note="escape">eschue</dfn>,
And namely that to us alle is due.
And whoso <dfn data-note="complains in any way">gruccheth ought</dfn>, he dooth folye,
And rebel is to hym that al may gye.
And certeinly a man hath moost honour
To dyen in his excellence and flour,
Whan he is <dfn data-note="sure">siker</dfn> of his goode name;
Thanne hath he doon his freend, ne hym, no shame.
And gladder oghte his freend been of his deeth,
Whan with honour <dfn data-note="given up (died)">up yolden</dfn> is his breeth,
Than whan his name <dfn data-note="faded">apalled</dfn> is for age,
For al forgeten is his <dfn data-note="prowess">vassellage</dfn>.
Thanne is it best, as for a worthy fame,
To dyen whan that he is best of name.
"The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.
Why grucchen we, why have we hevynesse,
That goode Arcite, of chivalrie flour,
Departed is <dfn data-note="with all proper honor">with duetee and honour</dfn>
Out of this foule prisoun of this lyf?
Why grucchen heere his cosyn and his wyf
Of his welfare, that loved hem so weel?
<dfn data-note="Can he show them his gratitude?">Kan he hem thank?</dfn> Nay, God woot, <dfn data-note="not a bit, not at all">never a deel</dfn>,
That both his soule and eek hemself offende,
And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende.
"What may I conclude of this longe <dfn data-note="process of thought, argument">serye</dfn>,
But after wo I <dfn data-note="advise">rede</dfn> us to be merye
And thanken Juppiter of al his grace?
And er that we departen from this place
I rede that we make of sorwes two
O parfit joye, lastynge everemo.
And looketh now, wher moost sorwe is herinne,
Ther wol we first <dfn data-note="make amends">amenden</dfn> and bigynne.
"Suster," quod he, "this is my fulle <dfn data-note="opinion">assent</dfn>,
With al th’avys heere of my <dfn data-note="parliament, assembly">parlement</dfn>,
That gentil Palamon, youre owene knyght,
That serveth yow with wille, herte, and myght,
And ever hath doon syn ye first hym knewe,
That ye shul of youre grace upon hym rewe,
And taken hym for housbonde and for lord.
Lene me youre hond, for this is oure accord.
Lat se now of youre wommanly pitee.
He is a kynges brother sone, pardee;
And though he were a povre <dfn data-note="young knight">bacheler</dfn>,
Syn he hath served yow so many a yeer,
And had for yow so greet adversitee,
It moste been considered, leeveth me,
For gentil mercy oghte to passen right."
Thanne seyde he thus to Palamon the knight:
"I trowe ther nedeth litel <dfn data-note="discourse">sermonyng</dfn>
To make yow assente to this thyng.
Com neer, and taak youre lady by the hond."
Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond
That highte matrimoigne or mariage,
By al the conseil and the baronage.
And thus with alle blisse and melodye
Hath Palamon ywedded Emelye.
And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,
Sende hym his love that hath it <dfn data-note="dearly paid for">deere aboght</dfn>,
For now is Palamon in <dfn data-note="complete happiness">alle wele</dfn>,
Lyvynge in blisse, in richesse, and in <dfn data-note="health, well-being">heele</dfn>,
And Emelye hym loveth so tendrely,
And he hire serveth so gentilly,
That nevere was ther no word hem bitwene
Of jalousie or any oother <dfn data-note="vexation">teene</dfn>.
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;
And God save al this faire compaignye! Amen.
