<div class="special-line"> The prologe of the Reves Tale. </div>
Whan folk hadde laughen at this <dfn data-note="foolish business">nyce cas</dfn>
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde,
But for the moore part they loughe and pleyde.
Ne at this tale I saugh no man <dfn data-note="get angry">hym greve</dfn>,
But it were oonly Osewold the Reve.
By cause he was of carpenteris craft,
A litel ire is in his herte ylaft;
He gan to <dfn data-note="complain">grucche</dfn>, and blamed it a lite.
"<dfn data-note="as I may prosper (I swear)">So theek</dfn>," quod he, "ful wel koude I thee quite
With <dfn data-note="deluding, tricking a proud miller">bleryng of a proud milleres ye</dfn>,
If that me liste speke of <dfn data-note="ribaldry, coarse jesting">ribaudye</dfn>.
But <dfn data-note="I">ik</dfn> am oold; me list not pley for age;
Gras tyme is doon; my fodder is now forage;
This white top writeth myne olde yeris;
Myn herte is <dfn data-note="as">also</dfn> <dfn data-note="molded">mowled</dfn> as myne heris,
But if I fare as dooth an <dfn data-note="fruit of the medlar">open-ers</dfn> —
That ilke fruyt is <dfn data-note="increasingly worse">ever lenger the wers</dfn>,
Til it be <dfn data-note="rowen">roten</dfn> in <dfn data-note="mullock (rubbish, refuse)">mullok</dfn> or in <dfn data-note="straw">stree</dfn>.
We olde men, I drede, so fare we:
Til we be roten, kan we nat be rype;
We <dfn data-note="dance">hoppen</dfn> alwey whil that the world wol pype.
For in oure wyl ther stiketh evere a nayl,
To have an <dfn data-note="white-haired">hoor</dfn> heed and a grene tayl,
As hath a leek; for thogh oure myght be goon,
Oure wyl desireth folie <dfn data-note="continually">evere in oon</dfn>.
For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;
Yet in oure asshen olde is fyr yreke.
"Foure <dfn data-note="embers, live coals">gleedes</dfn> han we, which I shal devyse —
<dfn data-note="boasting">Avauntyng</dfn>, liyng, anger, <dfn data-note="greed, avarice">coveitise</dfn>;
Thise foure sparkles longen unto <dfn data-note="old age">eelde</dfn>.
Oure olde lemes mowe wel been unweelde,
But wyl ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.
And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth,
As many a yeer as it is passed henne
Syn that my tappe of lif bigan to renne.
For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon
Deeth drough the tappe of lyf and leet it gon,
And ever sithe hath so the tappe yronne
Til that almoost al empty is the tonne.
The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chymbe.
The sely tonge may wel rynge and chymbe
Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yoore;
With olde folk, save dotage, is namoore!"
Whan that oure Hoost hadde herd this ser- monyng,
He gan to speke as lordly as a kyng.
He seide, "What amounteth al this wit?
What shul we speke alday of hooly writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
Or of a soutere a shipman or a leche.
Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme.
Lo Depeford, and it is half-wey pryme!
Lo Grenewych, ther many a shrewe is inne!
It were al tyme thy tale to bigynne."
"Now, sires," quod this Osewold the Reve,
"I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,
Thogh I answere, and somdeel sette his howve;
For leveful is with force force of-showve.
"This dronke Millere hath ytoold us heer
How that bigyled was a carpenteer,
Peraventure in scorn, for I am oon.
And, by youre leve, I shal hym quite anoon;
Right in his cherles termes wol I speke.
I pray to God his nekke mote to-breke;
He kan wel in myn eye seen a stalke,
But in his owene he kan nat seen a balke."
