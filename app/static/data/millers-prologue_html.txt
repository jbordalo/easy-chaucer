<div class="special-line"> Heere folwen the wordes bitwene the Hoost and the Millere. </div>
Whan that the Knyght had thus his tale ytoold,
In al the route nas ther yong ne oold
That he ne seyde it was a noble storie
And worthy for to <dfn data-note="remember">drawen to memorie</dfn>,
And namely the <dfn data-note="gendefolk">gentils</dfn> everichon.
Oure Hooste lough and swoor, "So moot I gon,
This gooth aright; <dfn data-note="the pouch is opened, i.e., the game is well begun">unbokeled is the male</dfn>.
Lat se now who shal telle another tale;
For trewely the game is wel bigonne.
Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye <dfn data-note="know">konne</dfn>,
Somwhat to <dfn data-note="with which to repay, or match">quite with</dfn> the Knyghtes tale."
The Millere, that <dfn data-note="because of being drunk">for dronken</dfn> was al pale,
So that <dfn data-note="hardly">unnethe</dfn> upon his hors he sat,
He nolde <dfn data-note="take off">avalen</dfn> neither hood ne hat,
Ne abyde no man for his curteisie,
But in <dfn data-note="a loud, ranting voice">Pilates voys</dfn> he gan to crie,
And swoor, "By armes, and by blood and bones,
I kan a noble tale for the nones,
With which I wol now <dfn data-note="pay back, requite">quite</dfn> the Knyghtes tale.”
Oure Hooste saugh that he was dronke of ale,
And seyde, "<dfn data-note="wait">Abyd</dfn>, Robyn, my <dfn data-note="dear">leeve</dfn> brother;
Som bettre man shal telle us first another.
Abyd, and lat us werken <dfn data-note="properly">thriftily</dfn>."
"By Goddes soule," quod he, "that wol nat I;
For I wol speke or elles go my wey.”
Oure Hoost answerde, "Tel on, <dfn data-note="in the Devil&#x27;s name">a devel wey</dfn>!
Thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome.”
"Now herkneth," quod the Millere, "<dfn data-note="one and all">alle and some</dfn>!
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke; I knowe it by my soun.
And therfore if that I <dfn data-note="The prefix mys- applies to both verbs.">mysspeke or seye</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="blame it on">Wyte it</dfn> the ale of Southwerk, I you preye.
For I wol telle a <dfn data-note="saint&#x27;s life; see n.">legende</dfn> and a lyf
Bothe of a carpenter and of his wyf,
How that a clerk hath <dfn data-note="deceived, made a fool of the carpenter">set the wrightes cappe</dfn>."
The Reve answerde and seyde, "<dfn data-note="stop your noisy talk, hold your tongue">Stynt thy clappe</dfn>!
Lat be thy lewed dronken <dfn data-note="ribaldry">harlotrye</dfn>.
It is a synne and eek a greet folye
To <dfn data-note="injure">apeyren</dfn> any man, or hym defame,
And eek to bryngen wyves in swich fame.
Thou mayst ynogh of othere thynges seyn."
This dronke Millere spak ful soone <dfn data-note="in reply">ageyn</dfn>
And seyde, "Leve brother Osewold,
Who hath no wyf, he is no <dfn data-note="cuckold">cokewold</dfn>.
But I sey nat therfore that thou art oon;
Ther been ful goode wyves many oon,
And evere a thousand goode <dfn data-note="as opposed to">ayeyns</dfn> oon badde.
That knowestow wel thyself, but if thou <dfn data-note="go mad">madde</dfn>.
Why artow angry with my tale now?
I have a wyf, pardee, as wel as thow;
Yet nolde I, for the oxen in my plogh,
Take upon me moore than ynogh,
As <dfn data-note="to judge, believe of">demen of</dfn> myself that I were <dfn data-note="i.e., a cuckold">oon</dfn>;
I <dfn data-note="want to believe">wol bileve</dfn> wel that I am noon.
An housbonde shal nat been inquisityf
Of Goddes <dfn data-note="secrets">pryvetee</dfn>, nor of his wyf.
So he may fynde <dfn data-note="God&#x27;s plenty">Goddes foyson</dfn> there,
Of the remenant nedeth nat enquere."
What sholde I moore seyn, but this Millere
He nolde his wordes for no man forbere,
But tolde his <dfn data-note="low-born fellows'">cherles</dfn> tale in his manere.
<dfn data-note="it displeases me, I regret">M'athynketh</dfn> that I shal <dfn data-note="repeat, narrate">reherce</dfn> it heere.
And therfore every gentil wight I preye,
For Goddes love, demeth nat that I seye
Of yvel entente, but for I moot reherce
Hir tales alle, be they bettre or werse,
Or elles falsen som of my mateere.
And therfore, whoso list it nat yheere,
Turne over the leef and <dfn data-note="choose">chese</dfn> another tale;
For he shal fynde ynowe, <dfn data-note="of every sort">grete and smale</dfn>,
Of <dfn data-note="historical, true">storial</dfn> thyng that <dfn data-note="concerns">toucheth</dfn> gentillesse,
And eek moralitee and hoolynesse.
Blameth nat me if that ye chese amys.
The Millere is a cherl; ye knowe wel this.
So was the Reve eek and othere mo,
And <dfn data-note="ribaldry, dirty stories">harlotrie</dfn> they tolden bothe two.
<dfn data-note="consider, think about (this)">Avyseth yow</dfn>, and put me out of blame;
And eek men shal nat <dfn data-note="take a joke seriously">maken ernest of game</dfn>.
