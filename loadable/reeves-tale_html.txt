At <dfn data-note="Trumpington">Trumpyngtoun</dfn>, nat fer fro <dfn data-note="Cambridge">Cantebrigge</dfn>,
Ther gooth a brook, and over that a <dfn data-note="bridge">brigge</dfn>,
Upon the whiche brook ther stant a <dfn data-note="mill">melle</dfn>;
And this is verray sooth that I yow telle:
A millere was ther dwellynge many a day.
As any pecok he was proud and gay.
<dfn data-note="play the bagpipes">Pipen</dfn> he koude and fisshe, and nettes <dfn data-note="mend">beete</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="turn up the cups (?), play a drinking game">turne coppes</dfn>, and wel wrastle and <dfn data-note="shoot (arrows)">sheete</dfn>;
Ay by his belt he baar a long <dfn data-note="cutlass">panade</dfn>,
And of a swerd ful <dfn data-note="sharp">trenchant</dfn> was the blade.
A joly <dfn data-note="small dagger">poppere</dfn> baar he in his <dfn data-note="pocket">pouche</dfn>;
Ther was no man, for peril, <dfn data-note="dared">dorste</dfn> hym touche.
A <dfn data-note="Shefheld knife">Sheffeld thwitel</dfn> baar he in his hose.
Round was his face, and <dfn data-note="he had a pug nose">camus was his nose</dfn>;
As <dfn data-note="bald">piled</dfn> as an ape was his skulle.
He was a <dfn data-note="bully, quarrelsome swaggerer">market-betere</dfn> atte fulle.
Ther dorste no wight hand upon hym <dfn data-note="lay">legge</dfn>,
That he ne swoor he sholde anon <dfn data-note="pay for (it)">abegge</dfn>.
A theef he was for sothe of <dfn data-note="grain">corn</dfn> and <dfn data-note="ground meal">mele</dfn>,
And that a <dfn data-note="sly one">sly</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="accustomed to stealing">usaunt for to stele</dfn>.
His name was <dfn data-note="called">hoote</dfn> <dfn data-note="haughty">deynous</dfn> Symkyn.
A wyf he hadde, ycomen of noble kyn;
The <dfn data-note="parson, priest">person</dfn> of the toun hir fader was.
With hire he yaf ful many a panne of bras,
For that Symkyn sholde <dfn data-note="make an alliance with his family">in his blood allye</dfn>.
She was <dfn data-note="raised">yfostred</dfn> in a nonnerye;
For Symkyn wolde no wyf, as he sayde,
<dfn data-note="unless">But</dfn> she were wel <dfn data-note="raised, educated">ynorissed</dfn> and a <dfn data-note="virgin">mayde</dfn>,
To saven his estaat of yomanrye.
And she was proud, and <dfn data-note="impudent">peert</dfn> as is a <dfn data-note="magpie">pye</dfn>.
A ful fair sighte was it upon hem two;
On halydayes biforn hire wolde he go
With his <dfn data-note="the dangling tip of the hood">typet</dfn> wounde aboute his heed,
And she cam after in a <dfn data-note="gown, mantle">gyte</dfn> of reed;
And Symkyn hadde hosen of the same.
Ther dorste no wight clepen hire but ‘"<dfn data-note="lady">dame</dfn>";
Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye
That with hire dorste <dfn data-note="flirt">rage</dfn> or ones pleye,
But if he wolde be slayn of Symkyn
With <dfn data-note="cutlass">panade</dfn>, or with knyf, or <dfn data-note="dagger">boidekyn</dfn>.
For jalous folk ben perilous <dfn data-note="always">everemo</dfn> —
Algate they wolde hire wyves wenden so.
And eek, for she was somdel <dfn data-note="besmirched, sullied (in reputation, by her illegitimacy)">smoterlich</dfn>,
She was <dfn data-note="literally, as haughty as ditch-water (OED. &quot;stinking with pride&quot;)">as digne as water in a dich</dfn>,
And ful of <dfn data-note="disdain">hoker</dfn> and of <dfn data-note="scom">bisemare</dfn>.
Hir thoughte that a lady sholde <dfn data-note="be aloof">hire spare</dfn>,
What for hire <dfn data-note="lineage">kynrede</dfn> and hir <dfn data-note="nurture, education">nortelrie</dfn>
That she hadde lerned in the nonnerie.
A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two
Of twenty yeer, withouten any mo,
Savynge a child that was of half yeer age;
In cradel it lay and was a propre <dfn data-note="boy">page</dfn>.
This wenche thikke and wel ygrowen was,
With <dfn data-note="pug nose">kamus nose</dfn> and eyen greye as glas,
With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye.
But right fair was hire heer; I wol nat lye.
This person of the toun, for she was feir,
<dfn data-note="intended">In purpos was</dfn> to maken hire his heir,
Bothe of his <dfn data-note="property">catel</dfn> and his <dfn data-note="house and its contents">mesuage</dfn>,
And straunge he made it of hir mariage.
His purpos was for to bistowe hire <dfn data-note="nobly">hye</dfn>
Into som worthy blood of <dfn data-note="noble lineage">auncetrye</dfn>;
For hooly chirches good mcot been despended
On hooly chirches blood, that is descended.
Therfore he wolde his hooly blood hon- oure,
Though that he hooly chirche sholde devoure.
<dfn data-note="large, profitable monopoly (sokene = exclusive right to grind grain in a given area)">Greet sokene</dfn> hath this millere, out of doute,
With whete and malt of al the land aboute;
And nameliche ther was a greet collegge
Men clepen the <dfn data-note="a name for King&#x27;s Hall, a college at Cambridge">Soler Halle</dfn> at Cantebregge;
Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt ygrounde.
And on a day it happed, <dfn data-note="at a time, once">in a stounde</dfn>,
Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye;
Men wenden <dfn data-note="surely">wisly</dfn> that he sholde dye.
For which this millere <dfn data-note="stole">stal</dfn> bothe mele and corn
An hundred tyme moore than biforn;
For <dfn data-note="previously">therbiforn</dfn> he stal but curteisly,
But now he was a theef <dfn data-note="to excess">outrageously</dfn>,
For which the <dfn data-note="master of the college">wardeyn</dfn> <dfn data-note="chided and made a fuss">chidde and made fare</dfn>.
But therof sette the millere nat a <dfn data-note="weed (i.e., nothing)">tare</dfn>;
He <dfn data-note="blustered fiercely">craketh boost</dfn>, and swoor it was nat so.
Thanne were ther yonge <dfn data-note="impoverished students">povre scolers</dfn> two,
That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye.
<dfn data-note="testy, headstrong">Testif</dfn> they were, and lusty for to pleye,
And, oonly for hire myrthe and <dfn data-note="pleasure, delight">revelrye</dfn>,
Upon the wardeyn bisily they crye
To yeve hem leve, but a litel <dfn data-note="time, while">stounde</dfn>,
To goon to mille and seen hir corn ygrounde;
And <dfn data-note="certainly">hardily</dfn> they dorste <dfn data-note="wager">leye</dfn> hir nekke
The millere sholde not stele hem half a pekke
Of corn by <dfn data-note="trickery">sleighte</dfn>, ne by force hem <dfn data-note="rob">reve</dfn>;
And at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve.
John highte that oon, and Aleyn highte that oother;
Of 0 toun were they born, that highte <dfn data-note="a town in the North of England">Strother</dfn>,
Fer in the north; I kan nat telle where.
This Aleyn maketh redy al his gere,
And on an hors the sak he caste anon.
Forth goth Aleyn the clerk, and also John,
With good swerd and with bokeler by hir syde.
John knew the wey — <dfn data-note="they needed">hem nedede</dfn> no gyde —
And at the mille the sak adoun he layth.
Aleyn spak first: "Al hayl, Symond, y-fayth!
Hou fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?"
"Aleyn, welcome," quod Symkyn, "by my lyf!
And John also, how now, what do ye heer?"
"Symond," quod John, "by God, <dfn data-note="need has no equal (i.e., necessity knows no law)">nede has na peer</dfn>.
<dfn data-note="he must (Nth)">Hym boes</dfn> serve hymself that has na <dfn data-note="servant">swayn</dfn>,
Or elles he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.
Oure manciple, I <dfn data-note="expect">hope</dfn> he wil be deed,
<dfn data-note="so ache (Nth)">Swa werkes</dfn> ay the <dfn data-note="teeth">wanges</dfn> in his heed;
And forthy is I come, and eek Alayn,
To grynde oure corn and carie it <dfn data-note="home (Nth)">ham</dfn> agayn;
I pray yow spede us <dfn data-note="hence (Nth)">heythen</dfn> <dfn data-note="(as fast) as you can">that ye may</dfn>."
"It shal be doon," quod Symkyn, "by my fay!
What wol ye doon whil that it is <dfn data-note="in process">in hande</dfn>?"
"By God, right by the <dfn data-note="hopper (of the mill)">hopur</dfn> wil I stande,"
Quod John, "and se <dfn data-note="how (Nth)">howgates</dfn> the corn <dfn data-note="goes (Nth)">gas</dfn> in.
Yet saugh I nevere, <dfn data-note="(I swear) by my father’s kin (i.e., on my family’s honor)">by my fader kyn</dfn>,
How that the hopur <dfn data-note="wags to and fro (Nth)">wagges til and fra</dfn>."
Aleyn answerde, ‘John, and <dfn data-note="will you (do) so (sua Nth)">wiltow swa</dfn>?
Thanne wil I be bynethe, <dfn data-note="by my head">by my croun</dfn>,
And se how that the mele falles doun
Into the trough; that <dfn data-note="shall (Nth)">sal</dfn> be my <dfn data-note="amusement">disport</dfn>.
For John, y-faith, I may been of youre sort;
I is as <dfn data-note="poor">ille</dfn> a millere as ar ye."
This millere smyled of hir <dfn data-note="foolishness">nycetee</dfn>,
And thoghte, "Al this nys doon but for a <dfn data-note="trick">wyle</dfn>.
They wene that no man may hem bigyle,
But <dfn data-note="by my wlfare (I swear)">by my thrift</dfn>, yet shal I <dfn data-note="trick them">blere hir ye</dfn>,
For al the sleighte in hir <dfn data-note="learning">philosophye</dfn>.
The moore <dfn data-note="ingenious, clever">queynte</dfn> <dfn data-note="tricks">crekes</dfn> that they make,
The moore wol I stele whan I take.
<dfn data-note="instead of">In stide of</dfn> flour yet wol I yeve hem <dfn data-note="bran">bren</dfn>.
‘The gretteste clerkes been noght wisest men,’
As whilom to the wolf thus spak the mare.
Of al hir art counte I <dfn data-note="not a weed (i.e., nothing)">noght a tare</dfn>."
Out at the dore he gooth ful pryvely,
Whan that he saugh his tyme, softely.
He looketh up and doun til he hath founde
The clerkes hors, ther as it stood ybounde
Bihynde the mille, under a <dfn data-note="arbor">levesel</dfn>;
And to the hors he goth hym faire and wel;
He <dfn data-note="strips off">strepeth of</dfn> the brydel right anon.
And whan the hors was <dfn data-note="loose">laus</dfn>, he gynneth gon
Toward the <dfn data-note="probably Lingay Fen, south of Trumpington">fen</dfn>, ther wilde mares renne,
And forth with "wehee," thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne.
This millere gooth agayn, no word he seyde,
But dooth his <dfn data-note="task, business">note</dfn>, and with the clerkes pleyde
Til that hir corn was faire and weel ygrounde.
And whan the mele is <dfn data-note="put in a sack">sakked</dfn> and ybounde,
This John goth out and fynt his hors away,
And gan to crie "Harrow!" and "<dfn data-note="alas">Weylaway</dfn>!
Oure hors is lorn, Alayn, for Goddes <dfn data-note="bones (Nth)">banes</dfn>,
Step on thy feet! <dfn data-note="hurry">Com of</dfn>, man, <dfn data-note="at once (Nth)">al atanes</dfn>!
Allas, our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn."
This Aleyn al forgat, bothe mele and corn;
Al was out of his mynde his housbondrie.
"What, <dfn data-note="which (Nth)">whilk</dfn> way is he <dfn data-note="gone (Nth)">geen</dfn>?" he gan to crie.
The wyf cam lepynge inward <dfn data-note="at a run, running">with a ren</dfn>.
She seyde, "Allas! youre hors goth to the fen
With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.
<dfn data-note="curses">Unthank</dfn> come on his hand that boond hym so,
And he that bettre sholde han <dfn data-note="tied">knyt</dfn> the reyne!"’
"Allas," quodJohn, "Aleyn, for Cristes peyne
Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil myn <dfn data-note="also (Nth)">alswa</dfn>.
I is ful <dfn data-note="strong">wight</dfn>, God <dfn data-note="knows (Nth)">waat</dfn>, as is a <dfn data-note="roe (Nth)">raa</dfn>;

<dfn data-note="bad luck">Ilhayl</dfn>! By God, Alayn, thou is a <dfn data-note="fool">fonne</dfn>!"
Thise sely clerkes han ful faste yronne
Toward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek John.
And whan the millere saugh that they were gon,
He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,
And bad his wyf go knede it in a <dfn data-note="loaf of bread">cake</dfn>.
He seyde, "I trowe the clerkes were <dfn data-note="leery">aferd</dfn>.
Yet kan a millere <dfn data-note="outwit, fool">make a clerkes berd</dfn>,
For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye!
Lo, wher he gooth! Ye, lat the children pleye.
They gete hym nat so lightly, by my croun."
<dfn data-note="these poor, hapless clerks">Thise sely clerkes</dfn> rennen up and doun
With "<dfn data-note="stay">Keep</dfn>! Keep! Stand! Stand! <dfn data-note="down here">Jossa</dfn>, <dfn data-note="watch out behind">warderere</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="go (Nth)">Ga</dfn> whistle thou, and I shal kepe hym heere!"
But shortly, til that it was verray nyght,
They koude nat, though they dide al hir myght,
Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,
Til in a dych they caughte hym atte laste.
Wery and weet, as beest is in the reyn,
Comth sely John, and with him comth Aleyn.
"Allas," quod John, "the day that I was born!
Now are we dryve <dfn data-note="to contempt">til hethyng</dfn> and til scorn.
Oure corn is stoln; men wil us fooles calle,
Bathe the wardeyn and oure felawes alle,
And namely the millere, weylaway!"
Thus pleyneth John as he gooth by the way
Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond.
The millere sittynge by the fyr he fond,
For it was nyght, and forther myghte they noght;
But for the love of God they hym bisoght
Of <dfn data-note="lodging">herberwe</dfn> and of <dfn data-note="refreshment, food">ese</dfn>, as for hir peny.
The millere seyde agayn, "If ther be eny,
Swich as it is, yet shal ye have youre part.
Myn hous is <dfn data-note="narrow, small">streit</dfn>, but ye han lerned <dfn data-note="the arts curriculum at the university, esp. logic">art</dfn>;
Ye <dfn data-note="know how by logical disputation to make">konne by argumentes make</dfn> a place
A myle brood of twenty foot of space.
Lat se now if this place may suffise,
Or make it <dfn data-note="large, roomy">rowm</dfn> with speche, as is youre gise."
"Now, Symond," seyde John, "by <dfn data-note="St. Cuthbert">Seint Cutberd</dfn>,
Ay is thou myrie, and this is faire answerd.
I have herd seyd, ‘Man sal taa of twa thynges:
<dfn data-note="Of two things one must take (taa) such (Slyk) as he finds or take such as he brings.">Slyk as he fyndes, or taa slyk as he brynges.’</dfn>
But specially I pray thee, hooste deere,
Get us som mete and drynke, and make us cheere,
And we wil payen trewely atte fulle.
With empty hand men may na haukes <dfn data-note="lure">tulle</dfn>;
Loo, heere oure silver, redy for to spende."
This millere into toun his doghter sende
For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos,
And boond hire hors, it sholde namoore go loos,
And in his owene chambre hem made a bed,
With sheetes and with <dfn data-note="blankets">chalons</dfn> faire <dfn data-note="spread">yspred</dfn>
Noght from his owene bed ten foot or twelve.
His doghter hadde a bed, al by hirselve,
Right in the same chambre <dfn data-note="side by side">by and by</dfn>.
It myghte be no bet, and cause why?
Ther was no <dfn data-note="larger">roumer</dfn> <dfn data-note="lodging">herberwe</dfn> in the place.
They soupen and they speke, hem to solace,
And drynken evere strong ale <dfn data-note="of the best sort">atte beste</dfn>.
Aboute mydnyght wente they to reste.
Wel hath this millere <dfn data-note="made his head shine">vernysshed his heed</dfn>;
Ful pale he was for dronken, and nat reed.
He <dfn data-note="belches">yexeth</dfn>, and he speketh thurgh the nose
As he were <dfn data-note="had hoarseness">on the quakke</dfn>, or <dfn data-note="had a cold">on the pose</dfn>.
To bedde he goth, and with hym goth his wyf.
As any jay she light was and jolyf,
So was hir joly whistle wel ywet.
The cradel at hir beddes feet is set,
To rokken, and to yeve the child to <dfn data-note="suck">sowke</dfn>.
And whan that dronken al was in the <dfn data-note="crock">crowke</dfn>,
To bedde wente the doghter right anon;
To bedde goth Aleyn and also John;
Ther nas na moore — <dfn data-note="they needed">hem nedede</dfn> no <dfn data-note="sleeping potion">dwale</dfn>.
This millere hath so <dfn data-note="surely">wisely</dfn> <dfn data-note="imbibed">bibbed</dfn> ale
That as an hors he <dfn data-note="snorts">fnorteth</dfn> in his sleep,
Ne of his tayl bihynde he took no keep.
His wyf bar hym a <dfn data-note="bass accompaniment">burdon</dfn>, a ful strong;
Men myghte hir <dfn data-note="snoring">rowtyng</dfn> heere two furlong;
The wenche rowteth eek, <dfn data-note="for fellowship&#x27;s sake, to keep them company">par compaignye</dfn>.
Aleyn the clerk, that herde this melodye,
He poked John, and seyde, "Slepestow?
Herdestow evere <dfn data-note="such a song (Nth)">slyk a sang</dfn> er now?
Lo, <dfn data-note="such a compline, last service of the day">swilk a complyn</dfn> is <dfn data-note="among (Nth)">ymel</dfn> hem alle;

This <dfn data-note="long (Nth)">lange</dfn> nyght ther <dfn data-note="I get no sleep">tydes me na reste</dfn>;
But yet, <dfn data-note="no matter">na fors</dfn>, al sal be for the beste.
For, John," seyde he, "als evere moot I thryve,
If that I may, yon wenche wil I <dfn data-note="copulate with">swyve</dfn>.
Som <dfn data-note="compensation, redress">esement</dfn> has lawe yshapen us,
For, John, ther is a lawe that says thus:
That <dfn data-note="if">gif</dfn> a man in <dfn data-note="one point">a point</dfn> be <dfn data-note="injured">agreved</dfn>,
That in another he <dfn data-note="shall be compensated">sal be releved</dfn>.
Oure corn is stoln, sothly, <dfn data-note="it cannot be denied">it is na nay</dfn>,
And we han had an <dfn data-note="hard time">il fit</dfn> al this day;
And syn I sal have <dfn data-note="none, no (Nth)">neen</dfn> amendement
<dfn data-note="in return for">Agayn</dfn> my los, I will have esement.
By Goddes <dfn data-note="soul (Nth)">sale</dfn>, it sal neen other bee!"
This John answerde, "Alayn, <dfn data-note="think carefully">avyse thee</dfn>!
The millere is a perilous man," he seyde,
"And gif that he out of his sleep <dfn data-note="start, awake">abreyde</dfn>,
He myghte doon us bathe a <dfn data-note="injury">vileynye</dfn>."
Aleyn answerde, ‘I counte hym <dfn data-note="i.e., not at all">nat a flye</dfn>."
And up he rist, and by the wenche he crepte.
This wenche lay uprighte and faste slepte,
Til he so ny was, er she myghte espie,
That it had been to late for to crie,
And shortly for to seyn, they were <dfn data-note="at one, together">aton</dfn>.
Now pley, Aleyn, for I wol speke of John.
This John lith stille <dfn data-note="five minutes or so">a furlong wey or two</dfn>,
And to hymself he <dfn data-note="pities (feels sorry for himself)">maketh routhe</dfn> and wo.
"Allas!" quod he, "this is a wikked <dfn data-note="trick">jape</dfn>;
Now may I seyn that I is but an <dfn data-note="fool">ape</dfn>.
Yet has my felawe somwhat for his harm;
He has the milleris doghter in his arm.
He <dfn data-note="took a risk his medes">auntred hym</dfn>, and has his nedes <dfn data-note="accomplished his purpose">sped</dfn>,
And I lye as a <dfn data-note="sack of chaff or rubbish">draf-sak</dfn> in my bed;
And when this jape is tald another day,
I sal been <dfn data-note="considered a fool">halde a daf</dfn>, a <dfn data-note="weakling">cokenay</dfn>!
I wil arise and auntre it, by my fayth!
‘<dfn data-note="the timid one is unlucky">Unhardy is unseely</dfn>,’ thus <dfn data-note="it is said (men = one)">men sayth</dfn>."
And up he roos, and softely he wente
Unto the cradel, and in his hand it hente,
And baar it softe unto his beddes feet.
Soone after this the wyf <dfn data-note="stopped her snoring">hir rowtyng leet</dfn>,
And gan awake, and wente hire out to pisse,
And cam agayn, and gan hir cradel mysse,
And groped heer and ther, but she foond noon.
"Allas!" quod she, "I hadde almoost <dfn data-note="gone astray">mysgoon</dfn>;
I hadde almoost goon to the clerkes bed.
Ey, benedicite! Thanne hadde I foule ysped!"
And forth she gooth til she the cradel fond.
She gropeth alwey forther with hir hond,
And foond the bed, and thoghte noght but good,
By cause that the cradel by it stood,
And nyste wher she was, for it was derk;
But faire and wel she <dfn data-note="crept">creep</dfn> in to the clerk,
And lith ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep.
Withinne a while this John the clerk up <dfn data-note="leapt">leep</dfn>,
And on this goode wyf he leith on soore.
<dfn data-note="such a good time">So myrie a fit</dfn> ne hadde she nat <dfn data-note="for a long time">ful yoore</dfn>;
He <dfn data-note="stabs, pierces">priketh</dfn> harde and depe as he were mad.
This joly lyf han thise two clerkes lad
Til that the <dfn data-note="third crow of the cock, an hour before dawn">thridde cok</dfn> bigan to synge.
Aleyn wax wery in the dawenynge,
For he had <dfn data-note="worked">swonken</dfn> al the longe nyght,
And seyde, "Fare weel, Malyne, sweete wight!
The day is come; I may no lenger byde;
But everemo, wher so I go or ryde,
I is thyn <dfn data-note="own (Nth)">awen</dfn> clerk, <dfn data-note="as I may prosper (1 swear)">swa have I seel</dfn>!"’
"Now, deere lemman," quod she, "go, far weel!
But er thow go, o thyng I wol thee telle:
Whan that thou wendest homward by the melle,
Right at the entree of the dore bihynde
Thou shalt a cake of half a busshel fynde
That was ymaked of thyn owene mele,
Which that I <dfn data-note="helped">heelp</dfn> my <dfn data-note="father">sire</dfn> for to stele.
And, goode lemman, God thee save and kepe!"
And with that word almoost she gan to wepe.
Aleyn up rist, and thoughte, "Er that it dawe,
I wol go crepen in by my felawe,"
And fond the cradel with his hand anon.
"By God," thoughte he, "al <dfn data-note="wrong (Nth)">wrang</dfn> I have mysgon.

Heere lith the millere and his wyf also."
And forth he goth, a.<dfn data-note="in the name of twenty devils">twenty devel way</dfn>,
Unto the bed ther as the millere lay.
He wende have <dfn data-note="crept">cropen</dfn> by his felawe John,
And by the millere in he creep anon,
And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak.
He seyde, ‘Thou John, thou <dfn data-note="pig&#x27;s head">swynes-heed</dfn>, awak,
For Cristes <dfn data-note="soul">saule</dfn>, and heer a noble game.
For by that lord that called is <dfn data-note="St. James">Seint Jame</dfn>,

"Ye, false harlot," quod the millere, "hast?

Thow shalt be deed, by Goddes dignitee!
Who dorste be so boold to <dfn data-note="degrade one’s lineage (by a union with someone of lower birth)">disparage</dfn>
My doghter, that is come of swich lynage?"
And by the <dfn data-note="Adam&#x27;s apple">throte-bolle</dfn> he caughte Alayn,
And he <dfn data-note="fetched him, struck him">hente hym</dfn> <dfn data-note="angrily">despitously</dfn> agayn,
And on the nose he smoot hym with his fest.
Doun ran the blody streem upon his brest;
And in the floor, with nose and mouth tobroke,
They walwe as doon two pigges in a <dfn data-note="bag">poke</dfn>;
And up they goon, and doun agayn anon,
Til that the millere <dfn data-note="stumbled on">sporned at</dfn> a stoon,
And doun he fil bakward upon his wyf,
That wiste no thyng of this nyce stryf;
For she was falle aslepe <dfn data-note="a short time">a lite wight</dfn>
With John the clerk, that waked hadde al nyght,
And with the fal out of hir sleep she <dfn data-note="started y">breyde</dfn>.
"Help! <dfn data-note="a famous shrine in Norfolk">hooly croys of Bromeholm</dfn>," she seyde,
"<dfn data-note="&quot;Into thy hands (I commend my spirit).&quot;">In manus tuas</dfn>! Lord, to thee I calle!
Awak, Symond! The feend is on me falle.
Myn herte is broken; help! I nam but deed!
Ther lyth oon upon my wombe and on myn heed.
Help, Symkyn, for the false clerkes fighte!"
This John stirte up as faste as ever he myghte,
And graspeth by the walles to and fro,
To fynde a staf; and she stirte up also,
And knew the <dfn data-note="arrangement of the interior, the nooks and crannies">estres</dfn> bet than dide this John,
And by the wal a staf she foond anon,
And saugh a litel shymeryng of a light,
For at an hole in shoon the moone bright,
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,
But sikerly she nyste who was who,
But as she saugh a whit thyng in hir ye.
And whan she gan this white thyng espye,
She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer,
And with the staf she drow ay neer and neer,
And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle,
And smoot the millere on the pyled skulle,
That doun he gooth, and cride, ‘"Harrow! I dye!"
Thise clerkes beete hym weel and lete hym lye,
And greythen hem, and tooke hir hors anon,
And eek hire mele, and on hir wey they gon.
And at the mille yet they tooke hir cake
Of half a busshel flour, ful wel ybake.
Thus is the proude millere wel ybete,
And hath ylost the gryndynge of the whete,
And payed for the soper everideel
Of Aleyn and of John, that bette hym weel.
His wyf is swyved, and his doghter als.
Lo, swich it is a millere to be fals!
And therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth,
"Hym thar nat wene wel that yvele dooth."
A gylour shal hymself bigyled be.
And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee,
Save al this compaignye, grete and smale!
Thus have I quyt the Millere in my tale.
