The Cook of Londoun, whil the Reve spak,
For joye him thoughte he <dfn data-note="scratched his back (he so enjoyed the tale it seemed as if the Reeve were scratching his back)">clawed him on the bak</dfn>.
"Ha! ha!" quod he, 'For Cristes passion,
This millere hadde a sharp <dfn data-note="proposition derived from disputation">conclusion</dfn>
<dfn data-note="proposition derived from disputation">Upon his argument</dfn> of herbergage!
Wel seyde Salomon in his langage,
'Ne bryng nat every man into thyn hous,'
For <dfn data-note="providing lodging">herberwynge</dfn> by nyghte is perilous.
Wel oghte a man <dfn data-note="to take heed">avysed for to be</dfn>
Whom that he broghte into his pryvetee.
I pray to God, so yeve me sorwe and care
If evere, sitthe I highte <dfn data-note="Roger of Ware (a town in I1lertfordshire, some thirty miles from London)">Hogge of Ware</dfn>,
Herde I a millere bettre <dfn data-note="tricked (cf. 111.215)">yset a-werk</dfn>.
He hadde a jape of malice in the derk.
But God forbede that we stynte heere;
And therfore, if ye <dfn data-note="grant, agree">vouche-sauf</dfn> to heere
A tale of me, that am a povre man,
I wol yow telle, as wel as evere I kan,
A litel jape that fil in oure citee."
Oure Hoost answerde and seide, "I <dfn data-note="agree">graunte it thee</dfn>.
Now telle on, Roger; looke that it be good,
For many a <dfn data-note="meat pie">pastee</dfn> hastow <dfn data-note="let blood (draw off the gravy from unsold pies to make them keep longer)">laten blood</dfn>,
And many a <dfn data-note="a kind of pie">Jakke of Dovere</dfn> hastow soold
That hath been twies hoot and twies coold.
Of many a pilgrym hastow <dfn data-note="damnation">Cristes curs</dfn>,
For of thy <dfn data-note="parsley">percely</dfn> yet they fare the wors,
That they han eten with thy <dfn data-note="fat goose that had been fed on stubble">stubbel goos</dfn>,
For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.
Now telle on, gentil Roger by thy name.
But yet I pray thee, be nat wroth for game;
A man may seye ful sooth in game and pley."
"Thou seist ful sooth," quod Roger, "by my fey!
But 'sooth pley, quaad pley,' as the Flemyng seith.
And therfore, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,
Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,
Though that my tale be of an hostileer.
But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit;
But er we parte, ywis, thou shalt be quit."
And therwithal he lough and made cheere,
And seyde his tale, as ye shul after heere.
