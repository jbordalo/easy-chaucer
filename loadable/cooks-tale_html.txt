<div class="special-line"> Heere bigynneth the Cookes Tale. </div>
A <dfn data-note="apprentice">prentys</dfn> whilom dwelled in oure citee,
And of a craft of <dfn data-note="victuallers, sellers of food">vitailliers</dfn> was hee.
<dfn data-note="merry">Gaillard</dfn> he was as goldfynch in the <dfn data-note="wood, thicket">shawe</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="very dark-complexioned">Broun as a berye</dfn>, a propre short felawe,
With lokkes blake, ykembd ful fetisly.
Dauncen he koude so wel and jolily
That he was cleped Perkyn Revelour.
He was as ful of love and <dfn data-note="wenching">paramour</dfn>
As is the hyve ful of hony sweete;
Wel was the wenche with hym myghte meete.
At every <dfn data-note="wedding party">bridale</dfn> wolde he synge and <dfn data-note="dance">hoppe</dfn>;
He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.
For whan ther any <dfn data-note="procession, equestrian display">ridyng</dfn> was in <dfn data-note="Cheapside">Chepe</dfn>,
Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe —
Til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn,
And daunced wel, he wolde nat come ayeyn —
And gadered hym a <dfn data-note="company">meynee</dfn> of his sort
To hoppe and synge and maken swich disport;
And ther they <dfn data-note="made an appointment">setten stevene</dfn> for to meete,
To pleyen at the dys in swich a streete.
For in the toune nas ther no prentys
That fairer koude caste a paire of dys
Than Perkyn koude, and therto he was free
Of his dispense, in <dfn data-note="a private place">place of pryvetee</dfn>.
That fond his maister wel in his <dfn data-note="business">chaffare</dfn>,
For often tyme he foond his <dfn data-note="strongbox">box</dfn> ful bare.
For sikerly a prentys <dfn data-note="reveller, profligate">revelour</dfn>
That <dfn data-note="makes a habit of">haunteth</dfn> <dfn data-note="dicing, gambling">dys</dfn>, <dfn data-note="debauchery">riot</dfn>, or <dfn data-note="womanizing">paramour</dfn>,
His maister shal it in his shoppe <dfn data-note="pay for">abye</dfn>,
Al have <dfn data-note="the master">he</dfn> no part of the <dfn data-note="entertainment (for which he pays)">mynstralcye</dfn>.
For thefte and riot, they been <dfn data-note="interchangeable">convertible</dfn>,
Al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible.
Revel and trouthe, as in a lowe degree,
<dfn data-note="Revelling and honesty, in a man of low rank, are always angry (i.e., incompatible) with each other.">They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.</dfn>
This joly prentys with his maister <dfn data-note="remained">bood</dfn>,
Til he were ny out of his <dfn data-note="apprenticeship">prentishood</dfn>,
Al were he <dfn data-note="rebuked">snybbed</dfn> bothe erly and late,
And somtyme lad with revel to <dfn data-note="Newgate prison">Newegate</dfn>.
But atte laste his maister hym bithoghte,
Upon a day, whan <dfn data-note="Perkyn">he</dfn> his <dfn data-note="probably his written certificate of release">papir</dfn> soghte,
Of a proverbe that seith this same word:
"Wel bet is roten appul out of hoord
Than that it <dfn data-note="rot">rotie</dfn> al the remenaunt."
So fareth it <dfn data-note="with respect to, with">by</dfn> a <dfn data-note="dissolute">riotous</dfn> servaunt;
It is ful lasse harm to lete hym <dfn data-note="gO away">pace</dfn>,
Than he <dfn data-note="corrupt">shende</dfn> alle the servantz in the place.
Therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance,
And bad hym go, with sorwe and with <dfn data-note="bad luck to him">meschance</dfn>!
And thus this joly prentys hadde his <dfn data-note="permission to leave">leve</dfn>.
Now lat hym <dfn data-note="revel, engage in debauchery">riote</dfn> al the nyght or leve.
And for ther is no theef withoute a lowke,
That helpeth hym to wasten and to <dfn data-note="suck (expend)">sowke</dfn>
Of that he <dfn data-note="steal">brybe</dfn> kan or borwe may,
Anon he sente his bed and his array
Unto a <dfn data-note="companion">compeer</dfn> of his owene sort,
That lovede dys, and revel, and disport,
And hadde a wyf that heeld for <dfn data-note="the sake of appearances">contenance</dfn>
A shoppe, and <dfn data-note="copulated for a living">swyved for hir sustenance</dfn>.
