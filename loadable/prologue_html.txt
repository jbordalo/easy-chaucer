A KNYGHT ther was, and that a worthy man,

To riden out, he loved <dfn data-note="prowess">chivalrie</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="fidelity">Trouthe</dfn> and <dfn data-note="good reputation">honour</dfn>, <dfn data-note="generosity of spirit">fredom</dfn> and <dfn data-note="refinement of manners">curteisie</dfn>.
Ful worthy was he in his lordes <dfn data-note="war">werre</dfn>,
And therto hadde he riden, no man <dfn data-note="farther">ferre</dfn>,
As wel in cristendom as in <dfn data-note="heathen lands">hethenesse</dfn>,
And evere honoured for his worthynesse;

And foughten for oure feith at <dfn data-note="Tlemcen (near Morocco)">Tramyssene</dfn>
<dfn data-note="in formal duels">In lystes</dfn> thries, and <dfn data-note="always">ay</dfn> slayn his foo.

And everemoore he hadde a <dfn data-note="outstanding reputation">sovereyn prys</dfn>.
And though that he were worthy, he was wys,
And of his <dfn data-note="bearing, manner">port</dfn> as meeke as is a mayde.
He nevere yet no <dfn data-note="rudeness">vileynye</dfn> ne sayde
In al his lyf unto <dfn data-note="any sort of person">no maner wight</dfn>.
He was a <dfn data-note="true">verray</dfn>, <dfn data-note="perfect (complete)">parfit</dfn> <dfn data-note="noble">gentil</dfn> knyght.
But for to tellen yow of his <dfn data-note="equipment">array</dfn>,
His hors were goode, but he was nat <dfn data-note="gaily dressed, richly attired">gay</dfn>.
Of <dfn data-note="coarse cloth">fustian</dfn> he wered a <dfn data-note="tunic">gypon</dfn>
Al <dfn data-note="stained by (rust from) his coat of mail">bismotered with his habergeon</dfn>,
For he was late ycome from his <dfn data-note="journey, expedition">viage</dfn>,
And wente for to doon his pilgrymage.
With hym ther was his sone, a yong <dfn data-note="squire, a young knight in the service of another knight">Squier</dfn>,
A <dfn data-note="lover">lovyere</dfn> and a <dfn data-note="lively">lusty</dfn> <dfn data-note="young knight, not yet a knight banneret">bacheler</dfn>,
With lokkes <dfn data-note="curled">crulle</dfn> as they were leyd in <dfn data-note="press (curler)">presse</dfn>.
Of twenty <dfn data-note="years">yeer</dfn> of age he was, I gesse.
Of his stature he was of <dfn data-note="moderate height">evene lengthe</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="marvelously">wonderly</dfn> <dfn data-note="agile">delyvere</dfn>, and of greet strengthe.
And he hadde been <dfn data-note="for a time, once">somtyme</dfn> <dfn data-note="on a cavalry expedition">in chyvachie</dfn>
In Flaundres, in Artoys, and <dfn data-note="Flanders and parts of northern France, where English armies fought">Pycardie</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="conducted himself well">born hym weel</dfn>, as of so litel <dfn data-note="time">space</dfn>,
In hope to <dfn data-note="find favor with his lady">stonden in his lady grace</dfn>.
<dfn data-note="embroidered">Embrouded</dfn> was he, as it were a <dfn data-note="meadow">meede</dfn>
Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and <dfn data-note="red">reede</dfn>.
Syngynge he was, or <dfn data-note="piping, playing the flute">floytynge</dfn>, al the day;
He was as fressh as is the month of May.
Short was his gowne, with sleves longe and wyde.
Wel <dfn data-note="knew how to">koude</dfn> he sitte on hors and faire ryde.
He koude songes make and wel endite,
<dfn data-note="joust">Juste</dfn> and <dfn data-note="also">eek</dfn> daunce, and <dfn data-note="well">weel</dfn> <dfn data-note="draw">purtreye</dfn> and write.
So <dfn data-note="passionately">hoote</dfn> he lovede that <dfn data-note="at nighttime">by nyghtertale</dfn>
He <dfn data-note="slept">sleep</dfn> namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale.
Curteis he was, <dfn data-note="modest (humble)">lowely</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="willing to serve, attentive">servysable</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="carved">carf</dfn> biforn his fader at the table.
A <dfn data-note="yeoman, freeborn servant">Yeman</dfn> hadde <dfn data-note="the Knight">he</dfn> and servantz <dfn data-note="no other">namo</dfn>
At that tyme, for <dfn data-note="he preferred to">hym liste</dfn> ride so,
And he was clad in cote and hood of grene.
A sheef of pecok arwes, bright and kene,
Under his belt he <dfn data-note="bore very properly">bar ful thriftily</dfn>
(Wel <dfn data-note="knew how to">koude</dfn> he <dfn data-note="care for his arrows, equipment for archery">dresse his takel</dfn> <dfn data-note="skillfully, as a good yeoman should">yemanly</dfn>;
His arwes <dfn data-note="did not fall short because of poorly adjusted feathers">drouped noght with fetheres lowe</dfn>),
And in his hand he baar a myghty bowe.
A <dfn data-note="close-cropped head">not heed</dfn> hadde he, with a <dfn data-note="very dark">broun</dfn> visage.
Of wodecraft wel koude he al the usage.
Upon his arm he baar a <dfn data-note="bright">gay</dfn> <dfn data-note="archer&#x27;s arm guard">bracer</dfn>,
And by his syde a swerd and a <dfn data-note="buckler, small shield">bokeler</dfn>,
And on that oother syde a gay daggere
<dfn data-note="ornamented">Harneised</dfn> wel and sharp as point of spere;
A <dfn data-note="image of St. Christopher">Cristopher</dfn> on his brest of silver <dfn data-note="bright">sheene</dfn>.
An horn he <dfn data-note="bore">bar</dfn>, the <dfn data-note="baldric, shoulder strap for the horn">bawdryk</dfn> was of grene;
A <dfn data-note="forester, game-keeper">forster</dfn> was he, soothly, as I gesse.
Ther was also a Nonne, a PRIORESSE,
That of hir smylyng was <dfn data-note="very">ful</dfn> <dfn data-note="unaffected and quiet">symple and coy</dfn>;
Hire gretteste <dfn data-note="oath">ooth</dfn> was but by <dfn data-note="St. Eligius">Seinte Loy</dfn>;
And she was <dfn data-note="called">cleped</dfn> madame Eglentyne.
Ful weel she <dfn data-note="sang">soong</dfn> the <dfn data-note="liturgy">service dyvyne</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="intoned">Entuned</dfn> in hir nose <dfn data-note="in a very seemly manner">ful semely</dfn>;
And Frenssh she spak ful faire and <dfn data-note="elegantly">fetisly</dfn>,
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,
For Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe.
<dfn data-note="at dinner">At mete</dfn> wel ytaught was she <dfn data-note="indeed">with alle</dfn>;
She <dfn data-note="allowed">leet</dfn> no morsel from hir lippes falle,
Ne wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe;
Wel <dfn data-note="knew how to">koude</dfn> she carie a morsel and <dfn data-note="take good care">wel kepe</dfn>
That <dfn data-note="no drop fell">no drope ne fille</dfn> upon hire brest.
In curteisie was set ful muchel hir lest.
Hir <dfn data-note="upper lip">over-lippe</dfn> wyped she so clene
That in hir <dfn data-note="cup">coppe</dfn> ther was no <dfn data-note="speck (spot the size of a farthing)">ferthyng</dfn> sene
Of <dfn data-note="grease">grece</dfn>, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.
Ful semely <dfn data-note="she reached for her food">after hir mete she raughte</dfn>.
And <dfn data-note="truly">sikerly</dfn> she was of <dfn data-note="excellent deportment">greet desport</dfn>,
And ful plesaunt, and amyable of <dfn data-note="bearing, manner">port</dfn>,
And <dfn data-note="took pains">peyned hire</dfn> to <dfn data-note="imitate">countrefete</dfn> <dfn data-note="the manners of the court">cheere</dfn>
<dfn data-note="the manners of the court">Of court</dfn>, and to been <dfn data-note="dignified in behavior">estatlich of manere</dfn>,
And to ben holden <dfn data-note="worthy of respect">digne of reverence</dfn>.
But for to speken of hire <dfn data-note="moral sense and solicitude">conscience</dfn>,
She was so charitable and so <dfn data-note="compassionate">pitous</dfn>
She wolde wepe, if that she <dfn data-note="saw">saugh</dfn> a mous
Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.
Of smale houndes hadde she that she fedde
With <dfn data-note="roasted meat">rosted flessh</dfn>, or milk and <dfn data-note="expensive fine white bread">wastel-breed</dfn>.
But <dfn data-note="sorely, bitterly">soore</dfn> wepte she if oon of hem were deed,
Or if men <dfn data-note="beat">smoot</dfn> it with a <dfn data-note="switch">yerde</dfn> <dfn data-note="smartly, painfully">smerte</dfn>;
And al was conscience and tendre herte.
<dfn data-note="very properly">Ful semyly</dfn> hir <dfn data-note="wimple, a head dress that covers all but the face">wympul</dfn> <dfn data-note="pleated">pynched</dfn> was,
Hir nose <dfn data-note="well formed">tretys</dfn>, hir eyen <dfn data-note="gray (?); the exact color intended is uncertain.">greye</dfn> as glas,
Hir mouth ful <dfn data-note="small, elegant">smal</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="moreover">therto</dfn> softe and <dfn data-note="red">reed</dfn>.
But <dfn data-note="certainly">sikerly</dfn> she hadde a fair forheed;
It was almoost a <dfn data-note="about seven to nine inches wide">spanne brood</dfn>, I <dfn data-note="believe">trowe</dfn>;
For, <dfn data-note="certainly">hardily</dfn>, she was nat undergrowe.
<dfn data-note="very elegant, well made">Ful fetys</dfn> was hir cloke, as I was <dfn data-note="aware">war</dfn>.
Of smal coral aboute hire arm she bar
A <dfn data-note="set">peire</dfn> of bedes, <dfn data-note="divided by large beads (gaudes) marking the Paternosters">gauded</dfn> al with grene,
And theron heng a brooch of gold ful <dfn data-note="bright">sheene</dfn>,
On which ther was first write a <dfn data-note="an A surmounted by a crown">crowned A</dfn>,
And after <dfn data-note="love conquers all; the phrase could apply to either divine or earthly love.">Amor vincit omnia</dfn>.
Another NONNE with hire hadde she,
That was hir <dfn data-note="a nun serving as a secretary to a prioress">chapeleyne</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="three priests; see n.">preestes thre</dfn>.
A MONK ther was, <dfn data-note="an extremely fine or handsome one">a fair for the maistrie</dfn>,
An <dfn data-note="monk with business outside the monastery">outridere</dfn>, that lovede <dfn data-note="hunting">venerie</dfn>,
A <dfn data-note="generous, virile">manly</dfn> man, to been an abbot able.
Ful many a <dfn data-note="fine">deyntee</dfn> hors hadde he in stable,
And whan he rood, men <dfn data-note="could hear his bridle">myghte his brydel heere</dfn>
<dfn data-note="jingle">Gynglen</dfn> in a whistlynge wynd <dfn data-note="as clearly">als cleere</dfn>
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel belle
Ther as this lord was kepere of the <dfn data-note="a subordinate monastery">celle</dfn>.
The <dfn data-note="the Benedictine Rule, established by St. Benedict and introduced into France by his follower St. Maurus">reule of Seint Maure or of Seint Beneit</dfn>â
By cause that it was old and <dfn data-note="somewhat narrow, strict">somdel streit</dfn>
This ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace,
<dfn data-note="This same monk let old things pass away (pace) and followed the customs of modern times.">And heeld after the newe world the space.
</dfn>
He <dfn data-note="gave">yaf</dfn> nat of that <dfn data-note="authoritative written statement">text</dfn> a <dfn data-note="plucked">pulled</dfn> hen,
That seith that hunters ben nat hooly men,
Ne that a monk, whan he is <dfn data-note="heedless of rules">recchelees</dfn>,
Is likned <dfn data-note="to">til</dfn> a fissh that is <dfn data-note="out of water">waterlees</dfn>â
This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre.
But <dfn data-note="that mat">thilke</dfn> text heeld he nat <dfn data-note="i.e., worth nothing">worth an oystre</dfn>;
And I seyde his opinion was good.
What sholde he studie and make hymselven <dfn data-note="crazy, mad">wood</dfn>,
Upon a book in cloystre <dfn data-note="always">alwey</dfn> to <dfn data-note="pore over">poure</dfn>,
Or <dfn data-note="work">swynken</dfn> with his handes, and laboure,
As <dfn data-note="St. Augustine, supposed author of a monastic rule bit = biddeth, commands">Austyn</dfn> bit? How shal the world be served?
Lat Austyn have his swynk to hym reserved!
Therfore he was a <dfn data-note="horseman, hunter on horseback">prikasour</dfn> <dfn data-note="certainly">aright</dfn>:
<dfn data-note="greyhounds">Grehoundes</dfn> he hadde as swift as fowel in flight;
Of <dfn data-note="tracking">prikyng</dfn> and of huntyng for the hare
Was al his <dfn data-note="pleasure">lust</dfn>, for no cost wolde he spare.
I <dfn data-note="saw">seigh</dfn> his sleves <dfn data-note="lined with fur">purfiled</dfn> at the hond
With <dfn data-note="expensive squirrel fur">grys</dfn>, and that the <dfn data-note="best to be had">fyneste of a lond</dfn>;
And for to festne his hood under his chyn,
He hadde of gold ywroght a ful <dfn data-note="skillfully made">curious</dfn> pyn;
A <dfn data-note="elaborate knot">love-knotte</dfn> in the <dfn data-note="larger">gretter</dfn> ende ther was.
His heed was <dfn data-note="bald">balled</dfn>, that shoon as any glas,
And eek his face, as he hadde been <dfn data-note="anointed, rubbed with oil">enoynt</dfn>.
He was a lord ful fat and <dfn data-note="in good condition">in good poynt</dfn>;
His eyen <dfn data-note="prominent or bright">stepe</dfn>, and rollynge in his heed,
That stemed as a forneys of a leed;
His bootes <dfn data-note="pliant">souple</dfn>, his hors in <dfn data-note="excellent condition">greet estaat</dfn>.
Now certeinly he was a fair <dfn data-note="ecclesiastical dignitary">prelaat</dfn>;
He was nat pale as a <dfn data-note="tormented spirit">forpyned goost</dfn>.
A fat swan loved he best of any roost.
His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.
A FRERE ther was, a <dfn data-note="jovial, pleasure-loving">wantowne</dfn> and a <dfn data-note="merry">merye</dfn>,
A <dfn data-note="friar licensed (by his order) to beg in a specific district">lymytour</dfn>, a ful <dfn data-note="dignified, important">solempne</dfn> man.
In alle the <dfn data-note="the four orders of friars">ordres foure</dfn> is noon that <dfn data-note="knows">kan</dfn>
So <dfn data-note="much">muchel</dfn> of <dfn data-note="sociability">daliaunce</dfn> and fair langage.
He hadde maad ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen at his owene cost.
Unto his ordre he was a noble <dfn data-note="supporter (pillar of the Church)">post</dfn>.
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he
With <dfn data-note="landowners">frankeleyns</dfn> <dfn data-note="everywhere">over al</dfn> in his contree,
And <dfn data-note="also">eek</dfn> with worthy wommen of the toun;
For he hadde power of confessioun,
As seyde hymself, moore than a curat,
For of his ordre he was <dfn data-note="licensed to hear confessions">licenciat</dfn>.
Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
And plesaunt was his absolucioun:
He was an <dfn data-note="lenient">esy</dfn> man to <dfn data-note="give">yeve</dfn> penaunce,
Ther as he <dfn data-note="expected">wiste</dfn> to have a good <dfn data-note="gift (literally food allowed to a member of a religious house)">pitaunce</dfn>.
For unto a <dfn data-note="poor">povre</dfn> ordre for to yive
Is signe that a man is wel <dfn data-note="confessed, penitent">yshryve</dfn>;
For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
He <dfn data-note="knew">wiste</dfn> that a man was repentaunt;
For many a man so hard is of his herte,
He <dfn data-note="cannot, is not able to">may nat</dfn> wepe, althogh <dfn data-note="he sorely, painfully, suffers">hym soore smerte</dfn>.
Therfore in stede of wepynge and preyeres
Men <dfn data-note="must give">moote yeve</dfn> silver to the povre freres.
His <dfn data-note="the dangling tip of the hood">typet</dfn> was ay <dfn data-note="stuffed">farsed</dfn> ful of knyves
And pynnes, for to <dfn data-note="give">yeven</dfn> faire wyves.
And certeinly he hadde a <dfn data-<dfn data-note="voice">note</dfn>="merry, pleasing">murye</dfn> note:
Wel koude he synge and pleyen on a <dfn data-note="stringed instrument">rote</dfn>;
Of yeddynges he baar outrely the pris.
His nekke whit was as the <dfn data-note="lily coe">flour-de-lys</dfn>;
Therto he strong was as a <dfn data-note="champion, representative in a judicial duel">champioun</dfn>.
He knew the tavernes wel in every toun
And <dfn data-note="every">everich</dfn> <dfn data-note="innkeeper">hostiler</dfn> and <dfn data-note="barmaid">tappestere</dfn>
<dfn data-note="better">Bet</dfn> than a <dfn data-note="leper">lazar</dfn> or a <dfn data-note="beggar-woman">beggestere</dfn>,
For unto <dfn data-note="such">swich</dfn> a worthy man as he
Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
To have with <dfn data-note="sick">sike</dfn> lazars aqueyntaunce.
It is nat <dfn data-note="honorable, respectable">honest</dfn>; it <dfn data-note="cannot be profitable">may nat avaunce</dfn>,
For to deelen with no <dfn data-note="such poor people">swich poraille</dfn>,
But al with riche and selleres of <dfn data-note="victuals, provisions">vitaille</dfn>.
And over al, <dfn data-note="where">ther as</dfn> profit sholde arise,
Curteis he was and <dfn data-note="graciously humble">lowely of servyse</dfn>;
Ther nas no man nowher so <dfn data-note="capable">vertuous</dfn>.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;<br>[And yaf a certeyn <dfn data-note="fee, fixed payment">ferme</dfn> for the <dfn data-note="grant (of an exclusive territory for begging)">graunt</dfn>;<br>Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his <dfn data-note="territory">haunt</dfn>;]
For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a <dfn data-note="shoe">sho</dfn>,
So plesaunt was his "In <dfn data-note="in the beginning (the opening words of Gen. and John 1, popular for devotions)">principio</dfn>,"
Yet wolde he have a <dfn data-note="farthing">ferthyng</dfn>, er he wente.
His <dfn data-note="total income">purchas</dfn> was wel bettre than his <dfn data-note="proper income">rente</dfn>.
And <dfn data-note="romp, sport (or flirt)">rage</dfn> he koude, as it were right a <dfn data-note="pup">whelp</dfn>.
In <dfn data-note="days on which disputes were reconciled">love-dayes</dfn> ther koude he muchel help,
For ther he was nat lyk a cloysterer
With a thredbare cope, as is a povre <dfn data-note="poor scholar, student">scoler</dfn>,
But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
Of double <dfn data-note="a very wide (hence expensive) cloth">worstede</dfn> was his <dfn data-note="short cloak">semycope</dfn>,
That <dfn data-note="was round">rounded</dfn> as a belle out of the <dfn data-note="casting mold">presse</dfn>.
Somwhat he <dfn data-note="lisped">lipsed</dfn>, for his <dfn data-note="affectation">wantownesse</dfn>,
To make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge;
And in his harpyng, whan that he hadde <dfn data-note="sung">songe</dfn>,
His eyen twynkled in his heed <dfn data-note="exactly">aryght</dfn>
As doon the <dfn data-note="srs">sterres</dfn> in the frosty nyght.
This worthy lymytour was <dfn data-note="called">cleped</dfn> Huberd.
A MARCHANT was ther with a forked berd,
In <dfn data-note="parti-colored cloth hye on">mottelee</dfn>, and hye on <dfn data-note="in a high saddle">horse</dfn> he sat;
Upon his heed a <dfn data-note="Flemish">Flaundryssh</dfn> bever hat,
His bootes clasped faire and <dfn data-note="elegantly, neatly">fetisly</dfn>.
His <dfn data-note="remarks, opinions">resons</dfn> he spak ful <dfn data-note="ceremoniously, solemnly">solempnely</dfn>,

Upon his feet, and in his hand a staf.

Out of the gospel he <dfn data-note="those">tho</dfn> wordes caughte,

For if a preest be <dfn data-note="evil">foul</dfn>, on whom we truste,

But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde,
So that the wolf ne made it nat <dfn data-note="go wrong">myscarie</dfn>;
He was a shepherde and noght a mercenarie.
And though he hooly were and vertuous,

And therto brood, as though it were a spade.
Upon the <dfn data-note="top">cop</dfn> right of his nose he hade

And therwithal he broghte us out of towne.

The wisdom of an heep of lerned men?
Of maistres hadde he <dfn data-note="more">mo</dfn> than thries ten,

Of which ther were a <dfn data-note="dozen">duszeyne</dfn> in that hous
Worthy to been <dfn data-note="stewards">stywardes</dfn> of <dfn data-note="income">rente</dfn> and lond
Of any lord that is in Engelond,

The <dfn data-note="reeve, manager of an estate or farm">Reve</dfn> was a <dfn data-note="lean">sclendre</dfn> <dfn data-note="dominated by the humor choler">colerik</dfn> man.
His berd was shave as <dfn data-note="close">ny</dfn> as ever he <dfn data-note="can">kan</dfn>;

His <dfn data-note="top of his head">top</dfn> was <dfn data-note="cut short">dokked</dfn> lyk a preest <dfn data-note="in the front">biforn</dfn>.
Ful longe were his legges and ful lene,
Ylyk a <dfn data-note="like a stick">staf</dfn>; ther was no calf ysene.
Wel koude he kepe a <dfn data-note="granary">gerner</dfn> and a <dfn data-note="bin (for storing grain)">bynne</dfn>;
Ther was noon auditour koude on him <dfn data-note="earn anything (by catching him out)">wynne</dfn>.
Wel wiste he by the droghte and by the reyn
The yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn.
His lordes sheep, his <dfn data-note="cattle">neet</dfn>, his <dfn data-note="herd of dairy cattle">dayerye</dfn>,
His swyn, his <dfn data-note="horses">hors</dfn>, his <dfn data-note="livestock">stoor</dfn>, and his <dfn data-note="poultry">pultrye</dfn>
Was hoolly in this Reves governynge,
And by his <dfn data-note="agreement, contract">covenant</dfn> yaf the rekenynge,
Syn <dfn data-note="since">that</dfn> his lord was twenty <dfn data-note="years">yeer</dfn> of age.
Ther koude no man brynge hym in <dfn data-note="arrears">arrerage</dfn>.
Ther nas <dfn data-note="manager of a farm">baillif</dfn>, ne <dfn data-note="herdsman">hierde</dfn>, nor oother <dfn data-note="servant">hyne</dfn>,
That he ne knew his <dfn data-note="trickery">sleighte</dfn> and his <dfn data-note="treachery">covyne</dfn>;
They were <dfn data-note="afraid the">adrad</dfn> of hym as of the <dfn data-note="the plague (?); see n.">deeth</dfn>.
His <dfn data-note="dwelling">wonyng</dfn> was ful faire upon an heeth;
With grene trees yshadwed was his place.
He koude bettre than his lord, <dfn data-note="buy property">purchace</dfn>.
Ful <dfn data-note="richly">riche</dfn> he was <dfn data-note="provided">astored</dfn> <dfn data-note="secretly">pryvely</dfn>.

To yeve and lene hym of his owene good,

</dfn>
In youthe he hadde lerned a good <dfn data-note="craft">myster</dfn>:
He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter.
This Reve sat upon a ful good <dfn data-note="horse">stot</dfn>
That was al <dfn data-note="dapple">pomely</dfn> grey and <dfn data-note="was called">highte</dfn> Scot.
A long <dfn data-note="outer coat">surcote</dfn> of <dfn data-note="dark blue">pers</dfn> upon he hade,
And by his syde he baar a rusty blade.
Of Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle,
Biside a toun men <dfn data-note="call">clepen</dfn> Baldeswelle.
Tukked he was as is a <dfn data-note="having his long coat hitched up and held by a girdle (R.), like a friar">frere</dfn> aboute,
And evere he rood the <dfn data-note="last">hyndreste</dfn> of oure <dfn data-note="company">route</dfn>.
A <dfn data-note="a server of summonses for an ecclesiastical court">Somonour</dfn> was ther with us in that place,
That hadde a <dfn data-note="fire-red">fyr-reed</dfn> <dfn data-note="cherubs">cherubynnes</dfn> face,
For <dfn data-note="pimpled eyen">saucefleem</dfn> he was, with eyen <dfn data-note="swollen eyelids">narwe</dfn>.
As hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe,
With <dfn data-note="infected with the scall, a skin disease; cf. Adam">scalled</dfn> browes blake and <dfn data-note="with hair fallen out">piled</dfn> berd.
Of his visage children were aferd.
Ther nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon,
<dfn data-note="Mercury, lead monoxide (lytarge), sulphur (brymstoon), borax (boras), white lead (ceruce), and cream of tartar were all used in medicine.">Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon,

That hym myghte helpen of his <dfn data-note="pimples, pustules">whelkes</dfn> white,
Nor of the <dfn data-note="swellings">knobbes</dfn> sittynge on his chekes.
Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek <dfn data-note="garlic, onions, leeks">lekes</dfn>,
And for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood;
Thanne wolde he speke and crie as he were <dfn data-note="crazy">wood</dfn>.
And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn,
Thanne wolde he speke no word but Latyn.
A fewe <dfn data-note="technical terms">termes</dfn> hadde he, two or thre,
That he had lerned out of som <dfn data-note="decretal, text of ecclesiastical law">decree</dfn>â â
No wonder is, he herde it al the day;
And eek ye knowen wel how that a jay
Kan clepen <dfn data-note="say &quot;Walter&quot;">"Watte"</dfn> as wel as kan the pope.
But whoso koude in oother thyng hym <dfn data-note="examine">grope</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="But anyone who knew how co test him further found that to be the extent of his learning.">Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophie;
</dfn>
Ay "Questio quid <dfn data-note="The question is, wha.t point of the law (applies)?">iuris</dfn>" wolde he crie.
He was a gentil <dfn data-note="buffoon, jester">harlot</dfn> and a kynde;
A bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde.
He wolde <dfn data-note="allow">suffre</dfn> for a quart of wyn
A good felawe to have his concubyn
A twelf month, and excuse hym atte <dfn data-note="completely">fulle</dfn>;
Ful prively a fynch eek koude he pulle.
And if he foond <dfn data-note="anywhere">owher</dfn> a good felawe,
He wolde techen him to have noon awe
In swich <dfn data-note="case, circumstances ercedekenes">Caas</dfn> of the ercedekenes <dfn data-note="excommunication">curs</dfn>,
But <dfn data-note="unless">if</dfn> a mannes soule were in his purs;
For in his purs he sholde ypunysshed be.
"Purs is the ercedekenes helle," seyde he.
But wel I <dfn data-note="know">woot</dfn> he lyed right in dede;
Of <dfn data-note="archdeacon&#x27;s curse, excommunication him">cursyng</dfn> oghte ech gilty man him <dfn data-note="be afraid">drede</dfn>,
For curs wol <dfn data-note="will slay">slee</dfn> right as <dfn data-note="absolution">assoillyng</dfn> savith,
And also war <dfn data-note="let him beware">hym</dfn> of a <dfn data-note="order for imprisonment">Significavit</dfn>.
In <dfn data-note="in (his) control at his owene">daunger</dfn> hadde he at his owene <dfn data-note="as he pleased">gise</dfn>
The yonge <dfn data-note="young women or young people">girles</dfn> of the diocise,
And knew hir <dfn data-note="secrets al hir">conseil</dfn>, and was al hir <dfn data-note="adviser of them all">reed</dfn>.
A <dfn data-note="wreath">gerland</dfn> hadde he set upon his heed,
As greet as it were for an <dfn data-note="sign of an alehouse">ale-stake</dfn>.
A bokeleer hadde he maad hym of a <dfn data-note="loaf of bread">cake</dfn>.
With hym ther rood a gentil <dfn data-note="a seller of indulgences">Pardoner</dfn>
Of <dfn data-note="a hospital at Charing Cross">Rouncivale</dfn>, his freend and his <dfn data-note="companion">compeer</dfn>,
That streight was comen fro the court of <dfn data-note="papal court">Rome</dfn>.
Ful loude he soong "Com hider, love, to <dfn data-note="Probably the refrain of a popular song">me!"</dfn>
This Somonour bar to hym a stif <dfn data-note="strong bass">burdoun</dfn>;
Was nevere <dfn data-note="trumpet">trompe</dfn> of half so greet a <dfn data-note="sound">soun</dfn>.
This Pardoner hadde <dfn data-note="hair">heer</dfn> as yelow as <dfn data-note="wax">wex</dfn>,
But smothe it heeng as dooth a <dfn data-note="clump, hank">strike</dfn> of <dfn data-note="flax">flex</dfn>;
By <dfn data-note="small strands">ounces</dfn> henge his lokkes that he hadde,
And therwith he his shuldres overspradde;
But thynne it lay, by <dfn data-note="strands">colpons</dfn> <dfn data-note="one by one">oon</dfn> and oon.
But hood, for <dfn data-note="to make an attractive appearance">jolitee</dfn>, wered he noon,
For it was <dfn data-note="packed">trussed</dfn> up in his <dfn data-note="pouch, knapsack">walet</dfn>.
Hym <dfn data-note="it seemed to him, he thought al of the newe">thoughte</dfn> he rood al of the newe <dfn data-note="in the very latest fashion">jet</dfn>;
<dfn data-note="with hair unbound, hanging loose">Dischevelee</dfn>, <dfn data-note="save for, except">save</dfn> his cappe, he rood al bare.
Swiche glarynge <dfn data-note="staring eyes">eyen</dfn> hadde he as an hare.
A <dfn data-note="Veronica, a reproduction of St. Veronica&#x27;s cloth, bearing the imprint of Christ&#x27;s face; a badge of the pilgrimage to Rome">vernycle</dfn> hadde he <dfn data-note="sewn">sowed</dfn> upon his cappe.
His <dfn data-note="pouch, knapsack">walet</dfn>, biforn hym in his <dfn data-note="large pocket (in a fold of his clothing)">lappe</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="brimful">Bretful</dfn> of <dfn data-note="papal indulgences">pardoun</dfn> comen from Rome al hoot.
A <dfn data-note="voice">voys</dfn> he hadde as <dfn data-note="high">smal</dfn> as hath a <dfn data-note="goat">goot</dfn>.
No berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have;
As smothe it was as it were late shave.
I <dfn data-note="believe geldyng or a">trowe</dfn> he were a geldyng or a <dfn data-note="a eunuch or a homosexual">mare</dfn>.
But of his craft, fro Berwyk into <dfn data-note="from one end of England to the other">Ware</dfn>
Ne was ther swich another pardoner.
For in his <dfn data-note="pouch, bag">male</dfn> he hadde a <dfn data-note="pillow-case">pilwe-beer</dfn>,
Which that he seyde was Oure Lady <dfn data-note="Our Lady&#x27;s veil">veyl</dfn>;
He seyde he hadde a gobet of the <dfn data-note="piece of the sail">seyl</dfn>
That Seint Peter hadde, whan that he wente
Upon the <dfn data-note="sea">see</dfn>, <dfn data-note="until">til</dfn> Jhesu Crist hym <dfn data-note="took">hente</dfn>.
He hadde a <dfn data-note="cross">croys</dfn> of <dfn data-note="a brass-like alloy">latoun</dfn> ful of stones,
And in a glas he hadde pigges bones.
But with thise relikes, whan that he fond
A povre <dfn data-note="parson upon">person</dfn> dwellynge upon <dfn data-note="in the countryside">lond</dfn>,
Upon a day he gat <dfn data-note="got himself">hym</dfn> moore moneye
Than that the person gat in monthes <dfn data-note="two">tweye</dfn>;
And thus, with feyned flaterye and <dfn data-note="tricks">japes</dfn>,
He made the person and the peple his apes.
But trewely to tellen atte <dfn data-note="at the last, finally">laste</dfn>,
He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste.
Wel koude he rede a lessoun or a <dfn data-note="liturgical texts, often from the Bible, read during Mass">storie</dfn>,
But <dfn data-note="best of all">alderbest</dfn> he song an <dfn data-note="Offertory (said or sung when offerings are made at Mass)">offertorie</dfn>;
For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe,
He moste preche and wel affile his <dfn data-note="smooth his speech">tonge</dfn>
To wynne silver, as he ful wel koude;
Therefore he <dfn data-note="sang">song</dfn> the <dfn data-note="more merrily">murierly</dfn> and loude.
Now have I toold you soothly, in a <dfn data-note="briefly">clause</dfn>,
Th'estaat, th'array, the nombre, and eek the cause
