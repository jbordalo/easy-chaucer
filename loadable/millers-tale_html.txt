Whilom ther was dwellynge at <dfn data-note="Oxford">Oxenford</dfn>
A riche <dfn data-note="churl">gnof</dfn>, that <dfn data-note="lodgers">gestes</dfn> heeld <dfn data-note="as boarders">to bord</dfn>,
And of his craft he was a carpenter.
With hym ther was dwellynge a <dfn data-note="impoverished student">poure scoler</dfn>,
Hadde lerned <dfn data-note="the arts curriculum at the university, esp. logic">art</dfn>, but al his <dfn data-note="fancy, desire">fantasye</dfn>
Was turned for to lerne astrologye,
And <dfn data-note="knew">koude</dfn> <dfn data-note="a certain number of astrological operations">a certeyn of conclusiouns</dfn>,
To demen by interrogaciouns,
If that men asked hym, <dfn data-note="at specific (astrological) hours">in certein houres</dfn>
Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures,
Or if men asked hym what sholde bifalle
Of every thyng; I may nat rekene hem alle.
This clerk was cleped <dfn data-note="courteous">hende</dfn> Nicholas.
Of <dfn data-note="secret">deerne</dfn> love he koude and of <dfn data-note="pleasure, satisfaction (of sexual desires)">solas</dfn>;
And therto he was <dfn data-note="sly">sleigh</dfn> and ful <dfn data-note="discreet, secretive">privee</dfn>,
And lyk a mayden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone, withouten any compaignye,
Ful fetisly ydight with herbes swoote;
And he hymself as sweete as is the roote
Of lycorys or any <dfn data-note="zedoary (a spice resembling ginger, used as a condiment and stimulant)">cetewale</dfn>.
His <dfn data-note="Prolemy&#x27;s treatise on astrology">Almageste</dfn>, and bookes grete and smale,

On shelves <dfn data-note="arranged">couched</dfn> at his beddes heed;
His <dfn data-note="cupboard, linen press">presse</dfn> ycovered with a <dfn data-note="coarse red woolen cloth">faldyng reed</dfn>;
And al above ther lay a gay <dfn data-note="psaltry">sautrie</dfn>,
On which he made <dfn data-note="at night">a-nyghtes</dfn> melodie
So swetely that all the chambre rong;
And <dfn data-note="&quot;The angel to the virgin [Mary]&quot;">Angelus ad virginem</dfn> he song;
And after that he song <dfn data-note="the King&#x27;s Tune (not identified)">the Kynges Noote</dfn>.
Ful often blessed was his myrie throte.
And thus this sweete clerk his tyme spente
After his freendes fyndyng and his rente.
This carpenter hadde wedded newe a wyf,
Which that he lovede moore than his lyf;
Of eighteteene yeer she was of age.
Jalous he was, and heeld hire <dfn data-note="closely">narwe</dfn> in cage,
For she was wylde and yong, and he was old
And demed hymself been <dfn data-note="like (?)">lik</dfn> a cokewold.
He knew nat <dfn data-note="Cato, author ofan elementary school text">Catoun</dfn>, for his wit was <dfn data-note="ignorant, unlearned">rude</dfn>,
That bad man sholde wedde his <dfn data-note="equal, counterpart">simylitude</dfn>.
Men sholde wedden after hire estaat,
For youthe and <dfn data-note="old age">elde</dfn> is often at debaat.
But sith that he was fallen in the <dfn data-note="trap">snare</dfn>,
He moste endure, as oother folk, his care.
Fair was this yonge wyf, and therwithal
As any <dfn data-note="weasel">wezele</dfn> hir body <dfn data-note="delicate">gent</dfn> and <dfn data-note="slender">smal</dfn>.
A <dfn data-note="belt">ceynt</dfn> she werede, <dfn data-note="with decorative strips">barred</dfn> al of silk,
A <dfn data-note="apron">barmclooth</dfn> as whit as <dfn data-note="morning">morne</dfn> milk
Upon hir <dfn data-note="loins">lendes</dfn>, ful of many a <dfn data-note="flounce">goore</dfn>.
Whit was hir <dfn data-note="shift, undergarment (over which aprons and more elaborate items of clothing are wom)">smok</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="embroidered">broyden</dfn> al bifoore
And eek bihynde, on hir <dfn data-note="collar">coler</dfn> aboute,
Of col-blak silk, withinne and eek withoute.
The <dfn data-note="ribbons">tapes</dfn> of hir white <dfn data-note="cap">voluper</dfn>
Were <dfn data-note="same color as">of</dfn> the same suyte of hir coler;
Hir <dfn data-note="headband">filet</dfn> brood of silk, and set ful hye.
And <dfn data-note="truly">sikerly</dfn> she hadde a <dfn data-note="flirtatious">likerous</dfn> ye;
Ful smale <dfn data-note="plucked">ypulled</dfn> were hire browes two,
And tho were bent and blake as any <dfn data-note="sloe (a plum-like fruit)">sloo</dfn>.
She was ful moore <dfn data-note="pleasing">blisful</dfn> on to see
Than is the newe <dfn data-note="early-ripe pear">pere-jonette</dfn> tree,
And softer than the <dfn data-note="wool">wolle</dfn> is of a <dfn data-note="sheep (ram)">wether</dfn>.
And by hir <dfn data-note="belt">girdel</dfn> heeng a purs of lether,
Tasseled with silk and <dfn data-note="adorned">perled</dfn> with <dfn data-note="a brass-like alloy">latoun</dfn>.
In al this world, to seken up and doun,
There nys no man so wys that koude <dfn data-note="imagine">thenche</dfn>
So gay a <dfn data-note="little doll">popelote</dfn> or swich a <dfn data-note="lower-class woman">wenche</dfn>.
Ful brighter was the shynyng of hir hewe
Than in the <dfn data-note="Tower of London (the mint)">Tour</dfn> the <dfn data-note="a gold coin (6 shillings, 8 pence)">noble</dfn> yforged newe.
But of hir song, it was as loude and <dfn data-note="eager, lively">yerne</dfn>
As any <dfn data-note="swallow">swalwe</dfn> sittynge on a <dfn data-note="barn">berne</dfn>.
Therto she koude skippe and make game,
As any kyde or calf folwynge his <dfn data-note="mother (dam)">dame</dfn>. 
Hir mouth was sweete as <dfn data-note="country drink">bragot</dfn> or the <dfn data-note="mead">meeth</dfn>,
Or hoord of apples leyd in hey or heeth.
<dfn data-note="skittish">Wynsynge</dfn> she was, as is a <dfn data-note="spirited">joly</dfn> colt,
Long as a mast, and <dfn data-note="straight">upright</dfn> as a <dfn data-note="cross-bow bolt">bolt</dfn>.
A brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler,
As brood as is the <dfn data-note="raised center of a shield">boos of a bokeler</dfn>.
Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye.
She was a prymerole, a <dfn data-note="primrose, &quot;pig&#x27;s eye,&quot; names of flowers">piggesnye</dfn>,
For any lord to <dfn data-note="lay">leggen</dfn> in his bedde,
Or yet for any good yeman to wedde.
Now, sire, and <dfn data-note="again">eft</dfn>, sire, so bifel the cas
That on a day this hende Nicholas
Fil with this yonge wyf to <dfn data-note="sport (sexually)">rage</dfn> and pleye,
Whil that hir housbonde was at <dfn data-note="Osney">Oseneye</dfn>,
As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful <dfn data-note="ingenious, clever">queynte</dfn>;
And prively he caughte hire by the <dfn data-note="elegant, pleasing (thing); i.e., pudendum">queynte</dfn>,
And seyde, "<dfn data-note="truly, indeed">Ywis</dfn>, but if ich have my wille,
For <dfn data-note="secret">deerne</dfn> love of thee, <dfn data-note="my love, sweetheart">lemman</dfn>, I <dfn data-note="die">spille</dfn>."
And heeld hire harde by the <dfn data-note="thighs">haunchebones</dfn>,
And seyde, "Lemman, love me <dfn data-note="at once, immediately">al atones</dfn>,
Or I wol dyen, <dfn data-note="as">also</dfn> God me save!"
And she <dfn data-note="sprang">sproong</dfn> as a colt dooth in the <dfn data-note="frame for holding a horse co be shod">trave</dfn>,
And with hir heed she <dfn data-note="turned rapidly, twisted">wryed faste</dfn> awey,
And seyde, "I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey!
Why, lat be!" quod she. "Lat be, Nicholas,
Or I wol crie '<dfn data-note="help">out, harrow</dfn>' and 'allas'!
Do wey youre handes, for youre curteisye!"
This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,
And spak so faire, and <dfn data-note="pressed his suit">profred him</dfn> so faste,
That she hir love hym graunted atte laste,
And swoor hir ooth, by <dfn data-note="Thomas Becket">Seint Thomas of Kent</dfn>,
That she wol been at his comandement,
Whan that she may hir <dfn data-note="opportunity">leyser</dfn> wel espie.
"Myn housbonde is so ful of jalousie
That but ye <dfn data-note="await, watch for (an opportunity)">wayte</dfn> wel and been <dfn data-note="discreet">privee</dfn>,
I woot right wel I nam but deed," quod she.
"Ye moste been ful <dfn data-note="secretive">deerne</dfn>, as in this cas."
"Nay, therofcare thee noght," quod Nicholas.
"A clerk hadde <dfn data-note="wasted his time">litherly biset his whyle</dfn>,
But if he koude a carpenter bigyle."
And thus they been accorded and ysworn
To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.
Whan Nicholas had doon thus everideel
And <dfn data-note="patted">thakked</dfn> hire aboute the <dfn data-note="loins">lendes</dfn> weel,
He kiste hire sweete and taketh his sawtrie,
And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodie.
Thanne fil it thus, that to the paryssh chirche,
Â»Cristes owene werkes for to wirche,
This goode wyf went on an <dfn data-note="holy day">haliday</dfn>.
Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,
So was it wasshen whan she <dfn data-note="left">leet</dfn> hir werk.
Now was ther of that chirche a parissh clerk,
The which that was ycleped Absolon.
<dfn data-note="curled">Crul</dfn> was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,
And <dfn data-note="stretched out like a fan">strouted as a fanne</dfn> large and brode;
Ful streight and evene lay his <dfn data-note="pretty">joly</dfn> <dfn data-note="parted hair">shode</dfn>.
His <dfn data-note="complexion">rode</dfn> was reed, his eyen greye as goos.
With <dfn data-note="window of St. Paul&#x27;s">Poules wyndow</dfn> <dfn data-note="carved">corven</dfn> on his shoos,
In hoses rede he wente <dfn data-note="elegantly">fetisly</dfn>.
Yclad he was ful <dfn data-note="tightly, in close-fitting clothes">smal</dfn> and proprely
Al in a <dfn data-note="tunic">kirtel</dfn> of a <dfn data-note="light blue">lyght waget</dfn>;
Ful faire and thikke been the <dfn data-note="laces">poyntes</dfn> set.
And therupon he hadde a gay <dfn data-note="surplice (ecclesiastical gown)">surplys</dfn>
As whit as is the blosme upon the <dfn data-note="twig">rys</dfn>.
A myrie <dfn data-note="young man_">child</dfn> he was, <dfn data-note="as">so</dfn> God me save.
Wel koude he <dfn data-note="let blood (as a medical treatment)">laten blood</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="cut hair">clippe</dfn> and shave,
And maken a <dfn data-note="deed">chartre</dfn> of lond or <dfn data-note="quitance (legal release of property)">acquitaunce</dfn>.
In <dfn data-note="twenty ways">twenty manere</dfn> koude he trippe and daunce
<dfn data-note="in the style, fashion">After the scole</dfn> of Oxenforde <dfn data-note="then">tho</dfn>,
And with his legges <dfn data-note="move quickly">casten</dfn> to and fro,
And pleyen songes on a smal <dfn data-note="rebeck, a kind of fiddle">rubible</dfn>;
Therto he song som tyme a loud <dfn data-note="high treble">quynyble</dfn>;
And as wel koude he pleye on a <dfn data-note="cithern, a stringed instrument">giterne</dfn>.
In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
That he ne visited with his <dfn data-note="entertainment">solas</dfn>,
Ther any <dfn data-note="merry barmaid">gaylard tappestere</dfn> was.
But sooth to seyn, he was <dfn data-note="somewhat squeamish">somdeel squaymous</dfn>
Of fartyng, and of speche <dfn data-note="fastidious">daungerous</dfn>.
This Absolon, that <dfn data-note="pretty, lively">jolif</dfn> was and gay,
Gooth with a <dfn data-note="censer">sencer</dfn> on the haliday,
<dfn data-note="censing">Sensynge</dfn> the wyves of the parisshe faste;
And many a <dfn data-note="loving">lovely</dfn> look on hem he caste,
And namely on this carpenteris wyf.
To looke on hire hym thoughte a myrie lyf,
She was so propre and sweete and likerous.
I dar wel seyn, if she hadde been a mous,
And he a cat, he wolde hire hente anon.
This parissh clerk, this joly Absolon,
Hath in his herte swich a love-longynge
That of no wyf took he noon offrynge;
For curteisie, he seyde, he wolde noon.
The moone, whan it was nyght, ful brighte shoon,
And Absolon his gyterne hath ytake;
<dfn data-note="for the sake of love">For paramours</dfn> he thoghte for to <dfn data-note="remain awake">wake</dfn>.
And forth he gooth, jolif and amorous, 
Til he cam to the carpenteres hous
A litel after cokkes hadde ycrowe,
And <dfn data-note="took his place">dressed hym</dfn> up by a <dfn data-note="hinged window (one that opens and closes)">shot-wyndowe</dfn>
That was upon the carpenteris wal.
He syngeth in his voys gentil and <dfn data-note="high">smal</dfn>, 
"Now, deere lady, if thy wille be,
I praye yow that ye wole <dfn data-note="have mercy">rewe</dfn> on me,"
Ful wel <dfn data-note="in harmony with">acordaunt to</dfn> his <dfn data-note="playing on the cithern">gyternynge</dfn>.
This carpenter awook, and herde him synge,
And spak unto his wyf, and seyde anon,
"What! Alison! Herestow nat Absolon,
That <dfn data-note="sings">chaunteth</dfn> thus <dfn data-note="next to our bed chamber&#x27;s">under oure boures</dfn> wal?"
And she answerde hir housbonde therwithal,
"<dfn data-note="yes, indeed">Yis</dfn>, God woot, John, I heere it <dfn data-note="every bit">every deel</dfn>."
This passeth forth; what wol ye <dfn data-note="better than well (i.e., what more would you have?)">bet than weel</dfn>?
Fro day to day this joly Absolon
So woweth hire that hym is wo bigon.
He waketh al the nyght and al the day;
He <dfn data-note="combs">kembeth</dfn> his lokkes brode, and made hym gay;
He woweth hire by <dfn data-note="go-betweens">meenes</dfn> and <dfn data-note="use of an agent">brocage</dfn>,
And swoor he wolde been hir owene <dfn data-note="servant">page</dfn>;
He syngeth, <dfn data-note="trilling">brokkynge</dfn> as a nyghtyngale;
He sente hire <dfn data-note="spiced, sweetened wine">pyment</dfn>, <dfn data-note="mead">meeth</dfn>, and spiced ale,
And <dfn data-note="cakes">wafres</dfn>, <dfn data-note="whistling, hissing">pipyng</dfn> hoot out of the <dfn data-note="fire">gleede</dfn>;
And, for she was of town, he <dfn data-note="offered money">profred meede</dfn>;
For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,
And somme <dfn data-note="i.e., by force">for strokes</dfn>, and somme for gen- tillesse.
Somtyme, to shewe his <dfn data-note="agility">lightnesse</dfn> and <dfn data-note="skill">maistrye</dfn>,
He pleyeth <dfn data-note="the part of Herod">Herodes</dfn> upon a <dfn data-note="stage">scaffold hye</dfn>.
But what availleth hym as in this cas?
She loveth so this hende Nicholas
That Absolon may <dfn data-note="go whistle">blowe the bukkes horn</dfn>;
He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn.
And thus she maketh Absolon hire <dfn data-note="fool, dupe">ape</dfn>,
And al his ernest turneth til a <dfn data-note="joke">jape</dfn>.
Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,
Men seyn right thus: "Alwey the <dfn data-note="nigh (at hand) sly one">nye slye</dfn>
Maketh the <dfn data-note="distant loved one to be disliked">ferre leeve to be looth</dfn>."
For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,
By cause that he fer was from hire sight,
This nye Nicholas stood <dfn data-note="in his way (i.e., prevented his being seen)">in his light</dfn>.
Now ber thee wel, thou hende Nicholas,
For Absolon may waille and synge "allas."
And so bifel it on a Saterday,
This carpenter was goon til Osenay;
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been to this conclusioun,
That Nicholas shal shapen hym a <dfn data-note="trick">wyle</dfn>
This <dfn data-note="innocent, simple, hapless">sely</dfn> jalous housbonde to bigyle;
And if so be the game wente aright,
She sholde slepen in his arm al nyght,
For this was his desir and hire also.
And right anon, withouten wordes mo,
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,
But dooth ful softe unto his chambre carie
Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye,
And to hire housbonde bad hire for to seye,
If that he axed after Nicholas,
She sholde seye she nyste where he was;
Of al that day she saugh hym nat with ye;
She <dfn data-note="believed">trowed</dfn> that he was <dfn data-note="ill">in maladye</dfn>,
For, for no cry hir mayde koude hym calle,
He nolde answere for thyng that myghte <dfn data-note="befall, happen">falle</dfn>.
This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,
That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,
And <dfn data-note="ate">eet</dfn> and <dfn data-note="slept">sleep</dfn>, or dide what hym leste,
Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.
This sely carpenter <dfn data-note="wondered about">hath greet merveyle</dfn>
<dfn data-note="wondered about">Of</dfn> Nicholas, or what thyng myghte hym <dfn data-note="ail">eyle</dfn>,
And seyde, "I am adrad, by Seint Thomas,
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.
God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!
This world is now ful <dfn data-note="unstable, ticklish">tikel</dfn>, sikerly.
I saugh today a <dfn data-note="corpse">cors</dfn> yborn to chirche
That now, on Monday last, I saugh <dfn data-note="whom">hym</dfn> <dfn data-note="work">wirche</dfn>.
"Go up," quod he unto his <dfn data-note="servant">knave</dfn> anoon,
"<dfn data-note="call out">Clepe</dfn> at his dore, or knokke with a stoon.
Looke how it is, and tel me boldely."
This knave gooth hym up ful <dfn data-note="boldly">sturdily</dfn>,
And at the chambre dore whil that he stood,
He cride and knokked as that he were wood,
"What, how! What do ye, maister Nicholay?
How may ye slepen al the longe day?"
But al for noght; he herde nat a word.
An hole he foond, ful lowe upon a bord,
Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe,
And at that hole he looked in ful depe,
And at the laste he hadde of hym a sight.
This Nicholas sat evere <dfn data-note="gaping straight up">capyng upright</dfn>,
As he had <dfn data-note="gazed">kiked</dfn> on the newe moone.
Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister <dfn data-note="immediately">soone</dfn>
In what <dfn data-note="condition">array</dfn> he saugh this ilke man.
This carpenter to blessen hym bigan,
And seyde, 'Help us, <dfn data-note="St. Frideswide, noted for her healing powers">Seinte Frydeswyde</dfn>!
A man woot litel what hym shal bityde.
This man is falle, with his <dfn data-note="astronomy">astromye</dfn>,
In some woodnesse or in som <dfn data-note="fit">agonye</dfn>.
I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!
Men sholde nat knowe of <dfn data-note="God&#x27;s secrets">Goddes pryvetee</dfn>.
<dfn data-note="yes">Ye</dfn>, blessed be alwey a lewed man
That noght but oonly his bileve kan!
So <dfn data-note="fared">ferde</dfn> another clerk with astromye;
He walked in the feeldes for to <dfn data-note="gaze">prye</dfn>
Upon the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,
Til he was in a <dfn data-note="clay pit">marle-pit</dfn> yfalle;
He saugh nat that. But yet, by Seint Thomas,
<dfn data-note="I feel sorry for">Me reweth soore of</dfn> hende Nicholas.
He shal be <dfn data-note="scolded for">rated of</dfn> his studiyng,
If that I may, by Jhesus, hevene kyng!
Get me a staf, that I may <dfn data-note="pry up from under">underspore</dfn>,
Whil that thou, Robyn, hevest up the dore.
He <dfn data-note="shall come (verb of motion is understood)">shal</dfn> out of his studiyng, as I gesse."
And to the chambre dore he gan hym dresse.
His knave was a strong <dfn data-note="fellow">carl</dfn> for the nones,
And by the haspe he <dfn data-note="heaved it off">haaf it of</dfn> <dfn data-note="at once, immediately">atones</dfn>;
Into the floor the dore fil anon.
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,
And evere <dfn data-note="gaped">caped</dfn> upward into the eir.
This carpenter <dfn data-note="supposed he was">wende he were</dfn> in despeir,
And hente hym by the sholdres myghtily,
And shook hym harde, and cride <dfn data-note="vigorously, loudly">spitously</dfn>,
"What! Nicholay! What, how! What, looke adoun!
Awak, and thenk on Cristes passioun!
I <dfn data-note="make the sign of the cross as a blessing over">crouche</dfn> thee from <dfn data-note="evil spirits">elves</dfn> and fro <dfn data-note="(evil) creatures">wightes</dfn>."
Therwith the <dfn data-note="a charm">nyght-spel</dfn> seyde he <dfn data-note="straightaway">anon-rightes</dfn>
On foure <dfn data-note="sides">halves</dfn> of the hous aboute,
And on the <dfn data-note="threshold">thresshfold</dfn> of the dore withoute:
"Jhesu Crist and <dfn data-note="St. Benedict">Seinte Benedight</dfn>,
Blesse this hous from every wikked <dfn data-note="creature">wight</dfn>,
<dfn data-note="against the evil spirits of the night (?)">For nyghtes verye</dfn>, the <dfn data-note="a charm">white pater-noster</dfn>!
Where <dfn data-note="did you go">wentestow</dfn>, <dfn data-note="St. Peter&#x27;s sister">Seinte Petres soster</dfn>?"
And atte laste this hende Nicholas
Gan for to <dfn data-note="sigh">sik</dfn> soore, and seyde, "Allas!
Shal al the world be lost <dfn data-note="right now">eftsoones now</dfn>?"
This carpenter answerde, "What seystow?
What! Thynk on God, as we doon, men that <dfn data-note="work">swynke</dfn>."
This Nicholas answerde, "Fecche me drynke,
And after wol I speke in <dfn data-note="in secret, confidentially">pryvetee</dfn>
Of certeyn thyng that <dfn data-note="concerns">toucheth</dfn> me and thee.
I wol telle it noon oother man, certeyn."
This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn,
And broghte of <dfn data-note="strong">myghty</dfn> ale a <dfn data-note="full">large</dfn> quart;
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,
This Nicholas his dore faste <dfn data-note="shut">shette</dfn>,
And doun the carpenter by hym he sette.
He seyde "John, myn hooste, <dfn data-note="beloved">lief</dfn> and deere,
Thou shalt upon thy trouthe swere me heere
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil <dfn data-note="reveal">wreye</dfn>,
For it is Cristes conseil that I seye,
And if thou telle it man, thou art <dfn data-note="lost">forlore</dfn>;
For this vengeaunce thou shalt han therfore,
That if thou <dfn data-note="betray">wreye</dfn> me, thou shalt be wood."
"Nay, Crist forbede it, for his hooly blood!"
Quod tho this <dfn data-note="innocent, ignorant, hapless">sely</dfn> man, "I nam no <dfn data-note="blabbermouth">labbe</dfn>,
Ne, though I seye, I nam <dfn data-note="do not like to gab">nat lief to gabbe</dfn>.
Sey what thou wolt, I shal it nevere telle
To child ne wyf, by <dfn data-note="Christ, who despoiled Hell of its captives">hym that harwed helle</dfn>!"
"Now John," quod Nicholas, "I wol nat lye;
I have yfounde in myn astrologye,
As I have looked in the moone bright,
That now <dfn data-note="on">a</dfn> Monday next, at <dfn data-note="a quarter way through the night; in April, after midnight">quarter nyght</dfn>,
Shal falle a reyn, and that so wilde and wood
That half so greet was nevere <dfn data-note="Noah&#x27;s">Noes</dfn> flood.
This world," he seyde, "in lasse than an hour
Shal al be <dfn data-note="drowned">dreynt</dfn>, so hidous is the shour.
Thus shal mankynde <dfn data-note="drown _hir">drenche</dfn>, and lese hir <dfn data-note="their lives">lyf</dfn>."
This carpenter answerde, "Allas, my wyf!
And shal she drenche? Allas, myn Alisoun!"
For sorwe of this he fil almoost adoun,
And seyde, "Is ther no remedie in this cas?"
"Why, <dfn data-note="yes indeed">yis</dfn>, for Gode," quod hende Nicholas,
"Tf thou wolt werken after <dfn data-note="learning">loore</dfn> and <dfn data-note="(good) advice">reed</dfn>.
Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene <dfn data-note="head (i.e., ideas)">heed</dfn>;
For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe:
"Werk al by conseil, and thou shalt nat <dfn data-note="be sorry">rewe</dfn>."
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil,
I <dfn data-note="afhrm, declare">undertake</dfn>, withouten mast and seyl,
Yet shal I saven hire and thee and me.

"Yis," quod this Carpenter, "ful <dfn data-note="long ago">yoore ago</dfn>."
"Hastou nat herd," quod Nicholas, "also

And therfore, woostou what is best to doone?
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thyng 354s

This sely carpenter goth forth his wey.
Ful ofte he seide "Allas and weylawey,"

And she was war, and knew it <dfn data-note="better">bet</dfn> than he,

And after that a tubbe and a kymelyn,
And pryvely he sente hem to his in,
And heng hem in the roof in pryvetee.

He sente his knave, and eek his <dfn data-note="servant girl">wenche</dfn> also,
Upon his <dfn data-note="business">nede</dfn> to London for to go.
And on the Monday, whan it drow to nyght,
He shette his dore withoute candel-lyght,
And <dfn data-note="arranged">dressed</dfn> alle thyng as it sholde be.
And shortly, up they clomben alle thre;
They seten stille wel a <dfn data-note="a couple of minutes">furlong way</dfn>.
"Now, Pater-noster, clom!" seyde Nicholay,
And "Clom!" quod John, and "Clom!" seyde Alisoun.

Doun of the laddre stalketh Nicholay,
And Alisoun ful softe adoun she spedde;
Withouten wordes mo they goon to bedde,
<dfn data-note="where">Ther as</dfn> the carpenter is <dfn data-note="accustomed">wont</dfn> to lye.
Ther was the revel and the melodye;
And thus lith Alison and Nicholas,
In bisynesse of myrthe and of solas,
Til that the belle of <dfn data-note="an early morning service, before daybreak">laudes</dfn> gan to rynge,
And freres in the chauncel gonne synge.
This parissh clerk, this amorous Absolon,
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,
Upon the Monday was at Oseneye
With compaignye, hym to disporte and pleye,
And axed <dfn data-note="by chance">upon cas</dfn> a cloisterer
Ful prively after John the carpenter;
And he <dfn data-note="drew">drough</dfn> hym apart out of the chirche,
And seyde, "I noot; I saugh hym heere nat wirche
Syn Saterday; I trowe that he be went
For tymber, ther oure abbot hath hym sent;
For he is wont for tymber for to go
And dwellen at the <dfn data-note="outlying farm">grange</dfn> a day or two;
Or elles he is at his hous, certeyn.
Where that he be, I kan nat soothly seyn."
This Absolon ful joly was and <dfn data-note="happy">light</dfn>,
And thoghte, "Now is tyme to <dfn data-note="remain awake">wake</dfn> al nyght,
For sikirly I saugh hym nat stirynge
Aboute his dore, syn day bigan to sprynge.
"<dfn data-note="as I may prosper">So moot I thryve</dfn>, I shal, at cokkes crowe,
Ful pryvely knokken at his wyndowe

To Alison now wol I tellen al
My love-longynge, for yet I shal nat <dfn data-note="fail">mysse</dfn>
That <dfn data-note="at least">at the leeste wey</dfn> I shal hire kisse.
Som maner confort shal I have, <dfn data-note="indeed, by my faith">parfay</dfn>.
My mouth hath <dfn data-note="itched">icched</dfn> al this longe day;
That is a signe of kissyng atte leeste.
Al nyght <dfn data-note="I dreamed">me mette</dfn> eek I was at a feeste.
Therfore I wol go slepe an houre or tweye,
And al the nyght thanne wol I wake and pleye."
Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon
Up <dfn data-note="riseth, rises">rist</dfn> this joly lovere Absolon,
And <dfn data-note="dresses himself handsomely">hym arraieth gay</dfn>, <dfn data-note="in every detail, completely">at poynt-devys</dfn>.
But first he cheweth <dfn data-note="Grain of Paradise, cardamom seed, a breath-sweetener">greyn</dfn> and lycorys,
To smellen sweete, er he hadde kembd his heer.
Under his tonge a <dfn data-note="a four-leafed sprig of herb paris (Paris quadrifolia) in the shape of a fourfold true-love knot">trewe-love</dfn> he beer,
For therby wende he to ben <dfn data-note="attractive">gracious</dfn>.
He rometh to the carpenteres hous,
And stille he <dfn data-note="stondeth, sands">stant</dfn> <dfn data-note="next to">under</dfn> the <dfn data-note="hinged window">shot-wyndowe</dfn>
Unto his brest it <dfn data-note="reached">raughte</dfn>, it was so lowe
And softe he cougheth with a <dfn data-note="small, gentle sound">semy soun</dfn>:
"What do ye, hony-comb, sweete Alisoun,
My faire <dfn data-note="bird (i.e., sweetheart)">bryd</dfn>, my sweete <dfn data-note="cinnamon">cynamome</dfn>?
Awaketh, <dfn data-note="sweetheart">lemman</dfn> myn, and speketh to me!
Wel litel thynken ye upon my wo,
That for youre love I swete ther I go.
No wonder is thogh that I <dfn data-note="grow faint">swelte</dfn> and <dfn data-note="sweat">swete</dfn>;
I <dfn data-note="yeam">moorne</dfn> as dooth a lamb after the tete.
<dfn data-note="truly, indeed">Ywis</dfn>, lemman, I have swich love-longynge
That lik a <dfn data-note="turtledove">turtel</dfn> trewe is my moornynge.
I may nat ete na moore than a mayde."
"Go fro the wyndow, <dfn data-note="you idiot">Jakke fool</dfn>," she sayde;
"As help me God, it wol nat be '<dfn data-note="come kiss me">com pa me</dfn>.'
I love another â and elles I were to blame â
Wel bet than thee, by Jhesu, Absolon.
Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston,
And lat me slepe, <dfn data-note="in the name of twenty devils">a twenty devel wey</dfn>!"
"Allas," quod Absolon, "and weylawey,
That trewe love was evere <dfn data-note="in such miserable circumstances">so yvel biset</dfn>!
Thanne kysse me, syn it may be no bet,
For Jhesus love, and for the love of me."
"Wiltow thanne go thy wey therwith?" quod she.
"Ye, certes, lemman," quod this Absolon.
"Thanne make thee redy," quod she, "I come anon."
And unto Nicholas she seyde stille,
"Now <dfn data-note="be quiet">hust</dfn>, and thou shalt laughen al thy fille."
This Absolon doun sette hym on his knees
And seyde, "I am a lord <dfn data-note="in every way">at alle degrees</dfn>;
For after this I hope ther cometh moore.
Lemman, thy grace, and sweete <dfn data-note="bird (i.e., sweetheart)">bryd</dfn>, thyn <dfn data-note="mercy, grace">oore</dfn>!"
The wyndow she <dfn data-note="opens">undoth</dfn>, and that in haste.
"<dfn data-note="finish up">Have do</dfn>," quod she, "<dfn data-note="hurry up">com of</dfn>, and <dfn data-note="be quick">speed the faste</dfn>,
Lest that oure neighebores thee espie."
This Absolon gan wype his mouth ful drie.
Derk was the nyght as <dfn data-note="pitch">pich</dfn>, or as the cole,
And at the wyndow out she putte hir hole,
And Absolon, hym fil no bet ne <dfn data-note="worse">wers</dfn>,
But with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers
Ful <dfn data-note="with relish">savourly</dfn>, er he were war of this.
Abak he stirte, and thoughte it was amys,
For wel he wiste a womman hath no berd.
He felte a thyng al rough and <dfn data-note="long-haired">long yherd</dfn>,
And seyde, "Fy! allas! what have I do?"
"Tehee!" quod she, and clapte the wyndow to,
And Absolon gooth forth <dfn data-note="sadly">a sory pas</dfn>.
"<dfn data-note="a beard! a trick!">A berd! A berd!</dfn>" quod hende Nicholas,
"By Goddes <dfn data-note="body">corpus</dfn>, this goth faire and weel."
This sely Absolon herde <dfn data-note="every bit">every deel</dfn>,
And on his lippe he gan for anger byte,
And to hymself he seyde, "I shal thee <dfn data-note="pay back (revenge)">quyte</dfn>."
Who rubbeth now, who <dfn data-note="rubs">froteth</dfn> now his lippes
With dust, with sond, with straw, with clooth, with chippes,
But Absolon, that seith ful ofte, "Allas!"
"My soule <dfn data-note="give">bitake</dfn> I unto Sathanas,
But me were levere than al this toun," quod he,
"Of this <dfn data-note="insult">despit</dfn> <dfn data-note="avenged">awroken</dfn> for to be.
Allas," quod he, "allas, I ne hadde <dfn data-note="tumed away">ybleynt</dfn>!"
His hoote love was coold and al <dfn data-note="quenched">yqueynt</dfn>;
For fro that tyme that he hadde kist hir ers,
Of paramours he sette nat a <dfn data-note="cress (i.e., something of no value)">kers</dfn>,
For he was heeled of his maladie.
Ful ofte paramours he gan <dfn data-note="repudiate">deffie</dfn>,
And weep as dooth a child that is ybete.
A softe paas he wente over the strete
<dfn data-note="to">Until</dfn> a smyth men cleped <dfn data-note="sir">daun</dfn> Gerveys,
That in his forge smythed <dfn data-note="ploughing equipment">plough harneys</dfn>;

This Absolon knokketh al <dfn data-note="gently">esily</dfn>,
And seyde, "<dfn data-note="open up">Undo</dfn>, Gerveys, and that anon."
"What, who artow?" "It am I, Absolon."
"What, Absolon! for Cristes <dfn data-note="dear cross">sweete tree</dfn>,
Why rise ye so <dfn data-note="early">rathe</dfn>? Ey, benedicitee!
What eyleth yow? Som <dfn data-note="good-looking girl">gay gerl</dfn>, God it woot,
Hath broght yow thus <dfn data-note="astir (?)">upon the viritoot</dfn>.
By <dfn data-note="St. Neot">Seinte Note</dfn>, ye woot wel what I mene."
This Absolon ne <dfn data-note="cared not a bean (i.e., nothing)">roghte nat a bene</dfn>
Of al his pley; no word agayn he yaf;
He hadde moore <dfn data-note="flax on his distaff (i.e., more business on hand)">tow on his distaf</dfn>
Than Gerveys knew, and seyde, "Freend so deere,
That hoote kultour in the <dfn data-note="hearth">chymenee</dfn> heere,
<dfn data-note="lend (as is not translated)">As lene</dfn> it me; I have therwith to doone,
And I wol brynge it thee agayn ful soone."
Gerveys answerde, "Certes, were it gold,
Or in a <dfn data-note="bag">poke</dfn> <dfn data-note="gold coins">nobles</dfn> alle <dfn data-note="countless">untold</dfn>,
Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smyth.
<dfn data-note="Ah, by Christ&#x27;s foe (i.e., the Devil)">Ey, Cristes foo!</dfn> What wol ye do therwith?"
"Therof," quod Absolon, "<dfn data-note="whatever may be">be as be may</dfn>.
I shal wel telle it thee to-morwe day" â
And caughte the kultour by the colde <dfn data-note="handle">stele</dfn>.
Ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele,
And wente unto the carpenteris wal.
He cogheth first, and knokketh therwithal
Upon the wyndowe, right as he dide er.
This Alison answerde, "Who is ther
That knokketh so? I <dfn data-note="swear">warante</dfn> it a theef."
"Why, nay," quod he, "God woot, my sweete <dfn data-note="beloved">leef</dfn>,
I am thyn Absolon, my <dfn data-note="darling">deerelyng</dfn>.
Of gold," quod he, "I have thee broght a ryng.
My mooder yaf it me, so God me save;
Ful fyn it is, and therto wel <dfn data-note="engraved">ygrave</dfn>.
This wol I yeve thee, if thou me kisse."
This Nicholas was risen for to pisse,
And thoughte he wolde <dfn data-note="make the joke even better">amenden al the jape</dfn>;
He sholde kisse his ers er that he scape.
And up the wyndowe dide he hastily,
And out his ers he putteth pryvely
Over the buttok, to the <dfn data-note="thigh">haunche-bon</dfn>;
And therwith spak this clerk, this Absolon,
"Spek, sweete bryd, I noot nat where thou art."
This Nicholas anon <dfn data-note="let fly">leet fle</dfn> a fart
As greet as it had been a <dfn data-note="thunderstroke">thonder-dent</dfn>,
That with the strook he was almoost <dfn data-note="blinded">yblent</dfn>;
And he was redy with his iren hoot,
And Nicholas amydde the ers he smoot.

The hoote kultour brende so his <dfn data-note="rump">toute</dfn>,
And for the <dfn data-note="pain">smert</dfn> he <dfn data-note="thought he would die">wende for to dye</dfn>.
As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye,
"Help! Water! Water! Help, for Goddes <dfn data-note="heart">herte</dfn>!"
This carpenter out of his slomber sterte,
And herde oon crien "water!" as he were wood,
And thoughte, "Allas, now comth <dfn data-note="Noah&#x27;s">Nowelis</dfn> flood!"
He sit hym up withouten wordes mo,
And with his ax he smoot the corde atwo,
And doun gooth al; he foond neither to selle,
<dfn data-note="He did not stop to sell bread or ale on the way (i.e., he wasted no time).">Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the <dfn data-note="floor">celle</dfn></dfn>
Upon the floor, and ther <dfn data-note="in a faint">aswowne</dfn> he lay.
Up stirte hire Alison and Nicholay,
And criden 'Out' and "Harrow" in the strete.
The neighebores, bothe <dfn data-note="i.e., everyone">smale and grete</dfn>,
In <dfn data-note="ran">ronnen</dfn> for to <dfn data-note="stare at">gauren on</dfn> this man,
That yet aswowne lay, bothe pale and wan,
For with the fal he <dfn data-note="broken">brosten</dfn> hadde his arm.
But stonde he moste unto his owene harm;
For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun
<dfn data-note="by">With</dfn> hende Nicholas and Alisoun.
They tolden every man that he was wood;
He was <dfn data-note="frightened">agast</dfn> so of Nowelis flood
Thurgh fantasie that of his <dfn data-note="foolishness">vanytee</dfn>
He hadde yboght hym knedyng tubbes thre,
And hadde hem hanged in the roof above;
And that he preyed hem, for Goddes love,
To sitten in the roof, <dfn data-note="for fellowship&#x27;s sake, to keep him company">par compaignye</dfn>.
The folk gan laughen at his fantasye;
Into the roof they <dfn data-note="stare">kiken</dfn> and they <dfn data-note="gape">cape</dfn>,
And turned al his harm unto a jape.
For what so that this carpenter answerde,
It was for noght, no man his reson herde.
With othes grete he was so <dfn data-note="overcome by oaths">sworn adoun</dfn>
That he was holde wood in al the toun;
For every clerk <dfn data-note="immediately">anonright</dfn> <dfn data-note="held, agreed">heeld</dfn> with oother.
They seyde, "The man is wood, my leeve brother";
And every wight gan laughen at this stryf.
Thus <dfn data-note="copulated with">swyved</dfn> was this carpenteris wyf,
For al his <dfn data-note="guarding">kepyng</dfn> and his jalousye,
And Absolon hath kist hir <dfn data-note="lower cye">nether ye</dfn>,
And Nicholas is scalded in the towte.
