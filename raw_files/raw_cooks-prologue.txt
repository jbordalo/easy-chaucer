    The prologe of the Cokes Tale.
The Cook of Londoun, whil the Reve spak,
For joye him thoughte he clawed him on the bak.
"Ha! ha!" quod he, 'For Cristes passion,
This millere hadde a sharp conclusion
Upon his argument of herbergage!
Wel seyde Salomon in his langage,
'Ne bryng nat every man into thyn hous,'
For herberwynge by nyghte is perilous.
Wel oghte a man avysed for to be
Whom that he broghte into his pryvetee.
I pray to God, so yeve me sorwe and care
If evere, sitthe I highte Hogge of Ware,
Herde I a millere bettre yset a-werk.
4326 clawed him on the bak: scratched his back (he so enjoyed the tale it seemed as if the Reeve were scratching his back)
4328-29 conclusion Upon his argument: proposition derived from disputation
4332 herberwynge: providing lodging
4333 avysed for to be: to take heed
4336 Hogge of Ware: Roger of Ware (a town in I1lertfordshire, some thirty miles from London)
4337 yset a-werk: tricked (cf. 111.215)
He hadde a jape of malice in the derk.
But God forbede that we stynte heere;
And therfore, if ye vouche-sauf to heere
A tale of me, that am a povre man,
I wol yow telle, as wel as evere I kan,
A litel jape that fil in oure citee."
Oure Hoost answerde and seide, "I graunte it thee.
Now telle on, Roger; looke that it be good,
For many a pastee hastow laten blood,
And many a Jakke of Dovere hastow soold
That hath been twies hoot and twies coold.
Of many a pilgrym hastow Cristes curs,
For of thy percely yet they fare the wors,
That they han eten with thy stubbel goos,
For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.
4340 vouche-sauf: grant, agree
4344 graunte it thee: agree
4346 pastee: meat pie laten blood: let blood (draw off the gravy from unsold pies to make them keep longer)
4347 Jakke of Dovere: a kind of pie
4349 Cristes curs: damnation
4350 percely: parsley
4351 stubbel goos: fat goose that had been fed on stubble
Now telle on, gentil Roger by thy name.
But yet I pray thee, be nat wroth for game;
A man may seye ful sooth in game and pley."
"Thou seist ful sooth," quod Roger, "by my fey!
But 'sooth pley, quaad pley,' as the Flemyng seith.
And therfore, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,
Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,
Though that my tale be of an hostileer.
But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit;
But er we parte, ywis, thou shalt be quit."
And therwithal he lough and made cheere,
And seyde his tale, as ye shul after heere.
